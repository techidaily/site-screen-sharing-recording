## 2\. Blender

Movavi Video Editor Plus is a good solution if you require a video editing program for dynamic films, such as sports footage, music videos, and fast-paced movies in general. Movavi is also popular with critics as it supports a large variety of video formats. Movavi Video Editor Plus is a video and audio editing tool that focuses on podcast and screen recording editing. It allows users to use text to adjust both audio and video.

This application is perfect for short video creations. Its creators advocate a three-step procedure: Record your screen then add a couple of the effects and share. Movavi Video Editor Plus may be all you need if all you want to do is polish your videos. Its editing skills are limited, so if you want to build highlight reels or review vast volumes of video, you'll be better off with something else.
