Kazam is excellent because it offers versatility. If you do not want to record the entire screen, you will have the option to record only a selected area.

You can check the official user guide about how to [take screenshots and screencasts with GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en) here.
