Have you ever watched gaming videos on Youtube with the gamer on the corner of the screen with a transparent background? They look very nice, right. You can also make such game streaming videos by yourself, thanks to Filmora's latest AI Portrait feature.

![game-streaming-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-poster.jpg)

There is a huge competition on Youtube for the game streaming category. If you want to stand out from the crowd and make your mark on viewers' minds, you have to make videos unique and different from all those streamers. One of the best ways to make your game streaming videos stunning and cool is to remove the background of your footage on the corner.

If you are going to do it traditionally, you will need so many materials like a green background sheet, a stand to hold that sheet, and more. But with Fimlora's AI Portrait feature, there is no need to purchase all these things. AI Portrait uses Artificial Intelligence to detect the human in the video and separate it from the background for you, saving you a lot of time and effort. It will help remove the background but you can also add various effects like border, glitches, and more. It will not only make your video stand out but it will also help your cover less area of the videos.

Using AI Portrait doesn't require any kind of technical skills or expertise. One can easily apply the AI Portrait effect with a single click. So, let's get started with the step-by-step guide.

![game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step7.png)

**Step 08:** If in some part of the video you want to show something covered by the character, you can easily change the character's position using keyframes for a smooth movement. To make sure the character footage is selected, pause the video when you want to change the position of the character and click on the keyframe button above the timeline.
