## Part 1: Before Recording

Before you start recording conversations on your Skype audio-video calls; it is important to understand whether it is legal to do so. If you live in the UK, you cannot record calls without informing your customers in advance that the call is being recorded. It is important to check your local area laws in advance and ask for permission to record calls. Breaking the rules can cause huge troubles with a heavy legal penalty.
