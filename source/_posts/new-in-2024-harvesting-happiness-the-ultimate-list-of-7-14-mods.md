This mod is going to change your regular farm into pink and white textures. Vines and flowers will be added to buildings; everyone likes to customize its gaming environment, which is a very sweet personalization off your farm.

At the north of Pelican Town, you can find Bathhouse Hot Spring. In the bathhouse hot spring, you can energize yourself and feel refreshed, but the whir of fans is a different kind of feel which you can find in an idyllic valley if you want the sound of smooth water running through hot spring while gameplay, you should use the mod bathhouse hot spring. The last update that we got on the bathhouse hot spring mod was from 2017, so we can say its upper back that another update can be a better version.

DCBurger's Portrait Mod is my favorite portrait mod because, unlike other anime character alterations, DCBurger's portraits are grainy. Featuring square jaws and more robust characteristics, all of the figures have a darker look. They do not match in with the vanilla Pelican Town, but they're a welcome change of pace from the charm. The Portrait mod, which allows for higher quality avatar portraits, is being used in the portraits.

![dcburgers-portrait-mod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dcburgers-portrait-mod.jpg)

DCBurger's Portrait Mod is my favorite portrait mod because, unlike other anime character alterations, DCBurger's portraits are grainy. Featuring square jaws and more robust characteristics, all of the figures have a darker look. They do not match in with the vanilla Pelican Town, but they're a welcome change of pace from the charm. The Portrait mod, which allows for higher quality avatar portraits, is being used in the portraits.

### 5.Stardew Anime Mods

![stardew-anime-mods](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-anime-mods.png)

For legitimate reasons, Stardew Anime Mods is one of the most beloved portrait mods of Stardew. It has pixel graphics in detail and is vividly hued, and it blends in well with vanilla Stardew Valley. However, it primarily contains portraits of Stardew Valley's young lady, which means bachelors will appear less dazzling in contrast.

### 6.Monster Valley

![monster-valley-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monster-valley-poster.jpg)

For the last year, video games about monsters meetings, swords, and birds have made their way into the gaming mainstream, and Monster Valley follows in their crazy tracks. The images and sprites of Pelican Town's most eligible families are turned into terrifying replacements in Monster Valley. Sebastian and Robin are transformed into devils, while Maru and Demetrius are transformed into stitched dolls. Elliott is transformed into a merman.

## How to install the best Stardew Valley mods

The majority of these mods are minor adjustments to the system's XNB files. All you have to do is install the XNB file after downloading the altered XNB, locate the individual XNB file in the Stardew Valley Content's fileâ€”the standard location is "C:Steam/steamapps/common/Stardew Valley/Content," and replace the original XNB with the altered one to use the best Stardew Valley mods. However, you should make a backup of the original if you decide to uninstall the mod.
