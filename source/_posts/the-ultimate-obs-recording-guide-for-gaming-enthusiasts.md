## The Bottom Line

We have answered all the queries on how to record gameplay with OBS. OBS is the most preferred desktop software application for live streaming and recording gameplay. However, some gamers find it difficult to use and there are some reports of OBS slowing down performance. As an alternative, we recommend Wondershare Filmora for recording your gameplay with webcam and editing the recorded gameplay for the professional outlook.
