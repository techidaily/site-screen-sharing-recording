## 2\. OBS Alternative To Record Gameplay

There are various reasons why users look for OBS alternative and ready to switch over to a premium software. OBS Studio does not have a clean user interface. Due to loads of features and functionalities, the user interface is complicated and the learning curve is steep.

As an alternative PS4 OBS is [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You will find many popular video creators using Filmora to [record screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), gameplay, webcam overlay.
