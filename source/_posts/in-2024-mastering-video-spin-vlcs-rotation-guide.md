Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.

Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.

Step 2: Go to Media > Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.

Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools > Effects and Filters option.

Step 10: You are back on Convert Window and finally, select a Destination File to save the new rotated video file and click on Start button.

Wait patiently for the process to get over and you can check the destination folder for the permanently rotated file.

Please note that this permanent rotation feature on VLC is only available for Windows users. Mac users are yet to get the feature and you can hope to see this permanent rotation feature in upcoming versions of VLC Media Player for MAC.

## Part 4\. Alternative Way to Rotate Videos Permanently

If you find the process of rotating video in VLC difficult and you want to rotate video on Mac as well, you should opt for [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The professional video editing software is available for both Windows and Mac users. Rotating any video is super easy and you can also edit the video like a professional with its amazing tool set. Here are the three steps on how to rotate video with Filmora.

Step 1: Download and install Filmora and launch the application. Import the video file and drop it on Timeline.

For macOS 10.12 or later

Step 2: Double-click on the video file and you will enter Video Editing Panel. Check Transform option and adjust the slider on Rotate option to rotate the video at any desired angle. Finally, click on OK button and you can check the video if the rotation is perfect.

Now, you can check the destination folder to find the video file which is now permanently rotated.

## The Bottom Line

VLC Media Player is a great tool to rotate any video at any desired angle. You can make this rotation temporary for momentary viewing purpose as well as make the rotation effect permanent so that it always opens with the set rotation effect. However, the steps to rotate permanently on VLC are somewhat complex. Therefore, we recommend Wondershare Filmora where you can rotate any video permanently in three simple steps.
