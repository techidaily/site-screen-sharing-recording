## Part 5\. Alternative Way to Record Computer Screen

If you are not satisfied with the limited features of free Screen App IO and you have decided to spend some to purchase a professional screen recorder, we recommend [Filmora Screen Recording Program](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora is both a screen recorder as well as a video editor. Therefore, after recording the video, you can add sound effects, video effects, filters, transitions and much more.
