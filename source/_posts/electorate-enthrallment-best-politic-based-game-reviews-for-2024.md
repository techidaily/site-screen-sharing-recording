There are several types of election simulation games. Some require analytical and critical thinking skills, some require creative thinking, and others are based on fun and adventure. Pigeon POOlitics is a fun game based on humor and focuses on the ridiculous side of elections. This game enables you to control a group of pigeons and poop over any candidate you want. Sounds interesting, right! Pooping on the opposite party member can turn them into your chosen political party member.
