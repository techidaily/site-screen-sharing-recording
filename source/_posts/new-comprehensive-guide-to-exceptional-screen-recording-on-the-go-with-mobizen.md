### Step 3: Changing the Display of Air Circle

Additionally, Mobizen screen recorder APK offers you to minimize the Air Bubble icon and even get rid of it by inserting your own picture and replacing it. The transparency of the Air Circle can also be altered accordingly. The “Hide Mode” hides the icon altogether.
