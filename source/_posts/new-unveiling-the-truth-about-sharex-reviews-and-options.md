## Conclusion

ShareX is great if you want to capture screenshots of your current screen as well as record your screen. However, the settings are not highly customizable while recording and the lack of features is a huge concern if you want to record regularly. That is why we have recommended the best ShareX alternatives, and our top pick is Wondershare Filmora which is easy to use and feature-rich.
