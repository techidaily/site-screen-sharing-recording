![ios screen recording ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-screen-recording.jpg)

![ ios screen recording ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-screen-recording-start.jpg)

1. The video recording will start after a 3-second delay and the recording button will turn red. A notification will also appear on the top indicating recording time.

1. This will stop the screen recording and the recorded video will be saved in the Photos app.

That's the steps of how to record your iPhone screen in iOS 11 and later versions. If you want to edit the recorded video with some video editing apps, do not miss [the top 10 best video editors for iPhone and iPad](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

If your iOS device is running a previous version older than iOS 11, and you do not want to update, then you can record your iPhone screen with some best screen recorders for iOS, or record with QuickTime. In the following section, we will show you how to do it.

## Part 2: Use [QuickTime](https://support.apple.com/quicktime) to Record Screens of iPhone/iPad (Version Before iOS 11)

People need to download and install a third-party iPhone/iPad screen recorder after jailbreaking the device and going through a complicated installation process. iOS is always risky to jailbreak your device as if you don’t do it carefully your device will get broken. It means your device will stop functioning and you will need to go to Apple care for getting it fixed. Jailbreaking also voids your warranty. So rather than going through these risks, people preferred using QuickTime to record their Phone/iPad’s screen.

With QuickTime media player you could record your iPhone/iPad’s Screen. For recording your iPhone/iPad screen with the help of QuickTime, you would need Mac OS X. Below are the steps to record your iPhone/iPad screen on your Mac by using QuickTime.

1\. Connect your iOS device (iPhone/iPad/iPod touch) to your Mac with a USB cable.

![quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20logo.jpg)

2\. Launch QuickTime on your Mac available in the application folder.

3\. Click on the File menu on the QuickTime menu bar and choose New Movie Recording.

![quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20new%20moive.jpg)

4\. A video recording screen will open. Now slide the cursor over that window to make the record and volume button visible.

5\. Click on the arrow next to the red record button to show the camera and microphone recording options. Choose your device from the list of devices and you will be able to see your device screen in the QuickTime window.

6\. Click on the red record button when you want to start recording.

![quicktime screen recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20iphone.jpg)

7\. To stop the recording of the screen of your iOS device, click on the Stop button at the video recorder window.

8\. If you want to edit the video, you can do it in QuickTime (for basic editing). You can also save the recorded video first and then edit it later. You can directly save it as it is in QuickTime by going to File Menu and clicking on save option.

The recorded video will be saved in .mov file format which you can later export to view on certain devices. You can edit the video later in QuickTime, Wondershare Filmora, or others and share it online for tutorials or demonstration, and whatever you want to do with it. This method of recording the iPhone/iPad screen is useful for devices running the iOS version lower than 11\. This is a far safer method to record device screen video than jailbreaking. But with the addition of a mobile screen recorder app in iOS 11 and above, it seems a little bit clumsy by using QuickTime.

**Conclusion**

iPhone/iPad screen recorder is a very useful tool when you want to record tutorials, demonstrations, or report bugs. The demand for mobile screen recorders is rapidly increasing. Youngsters also love recording funny clips and videos to share the video on social media networks and other platforms. So which method offered above is better, no definite answer. All you need to consider is your own situation. But if you are looking for a screen recorder to [record screen on computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which also provides better video editing features, like [blurring the private info](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then try Wondershare Filmora.
