Games will run at 60 frames per second (fps) and at a resolution of 400x200 from the original screen on Citra. Playing certain games can be similar to using a gamepad on an Xbox 360\.

Apparently, it was the first emulator that was developed and launched for 32-bit operating systems.

Updates and new builds have been created by developers to deal with bugs in programs.

**Pros:**

* Can function well with low specs systems.

**Price:** Free

3DMOO is also one of the best 3Ds emulators for PC. ICHFLY, the company that developed the GBA emulator for the NDS, created the emulator. Users of Windows & Linux are the only ones who can run this Nintendo 3DS emulator. The processing would be too slow for all the commercial games of the Nintendo 3DS, though 3DMOO supports all of them. The game might crash frequently, ruining your gaming experience. It was being developed around 2014, but suddenly the development process was stopped, so it now functions only through the command line. Source code files for the emulator are available on Github. The emulator is not available officially today but can be downloaded.

**Pros:**

* Open-Source Program.
* Provides support for both Windows and Linux users.

**Cons:**

This 3DS emulator for PC is actually a very popular one. Upgrades can be purchased by paying an affordable price. Once you download the latest version, you can download the older versions also.
