**Google meet mute** is a highly effective feature available to the participants in a meeting. Sometimes there may be distortion in the background, so individuals can mute their mic to avoid any disturbance in the meeting. It is possible for the host to mute an attendee in the meeting, or themselves as well. While the person is muted, they can still listen to what is being discussed in the meeting, but other members will not be able to listen to them until they are unmuted.

Do you want help to figure out **how to mute Google Meet**? Don’t worry, we have a whole bunch of information for you!

## Part 1: How Does the Mute Button in Google Meet Work?

The mute button in Google Meet is like a blessing in disguise, with just one click you can silence your mic. This way the participant can still hear what is going on in the session, but they are not audible to anyone else. So, if for instance, you are only a listener in the session and do not want to contribute, then you can mute your microphone.

Additionally, if an individual wants to participate in a meeting, they can unmute their microphone and then quickly mute it again once they have contributed. With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.

## Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?

While many believe using the mute feature on Google Meet is a tricky task, the question of **how to mute a Google Meet** is fairly simple.

All an individual has to do is click the microphone button located on the bottom of their screen and they will be muted.

![Google Meet Mute](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-microphone-on-google-meet.jpg)

If they click that same button again, they will be unmuted.

## Part 3: How to Mute Someone in Google Meet?

There are times when individuals are not aware that the background noise of their surroundings is causing a disturbance in the meeting. That is when muting someone can come in handy! Basically in this, a host or other participants in the meeting can mute an individual based on need. However, there is an eligibility criterion they must adhere to in order to get the muting permissions.

### The Eligibility Criteria To Mute Someone in Google Meet

Before looking into **how to mute someone on Google Meet**, check if any of the following scenarios apply to you,

* During video calls that are hosted through personal Google accounts, only the moderator can mute a person.
* Google Meet calls made through Google workspace accounts only permit a person, from the domain which organized the meeting, to mute a participant.
* During a video call arranged by using an educational Google account, only the individual who has created the meeting / is the owner of a calendar can mute other individuals.

So, if any of these circumstances apply to you, then you can easily mute someone in a Google Meet session. The process involves the following steps,

Click onto a participant’s picture and click Mute or if this step is not working for you, then at the bottom right of your video room on Google Meet, click people , once you do that a menu will appear on the side of your screen.

Click on the arrow next to the name of the person you would like to mute. Once you do that, a drop-down menu will appear with three options.

## Part 4: How to Mute All Participants in Google Meet?

Want to convey your message to everyone without having some interrupt you and have you lose your train? Mute everyone!

Important Note: Host Management should be turned on prior to the commencement of the meeting to use the Google Meet Mute option to mute all participants at the same time. Additionally, the Google Meet mute all function is only available for Educational accounts and it can only be used by meeting creators and owners of the calendars.

## Part 5: Best Chrome Extensions to Mute Everyone in Google Meet

Well, it’s not like everyone has an educational Google account through which they can access the mute all feature, so what do those individuals do. They can get themselves some of the best chrome extensions which allow them to use the mute all option without creating an educational Google account.

The mute button in Google Meet is like a blessing in disguise, with just one click you can silence your mic.

So, if for instance, you are only a listener in the session and do not want to contribute, then you can mute your microphone.

Additionally, if an individual wants to participate in a meeting, they can unmute their microphone and then quickly mute it again once they have contributed. With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.

## Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?

While many believe using the mute feature on Google Meet is a tricky task, the question of **how to mute a Google Meet** is fairly simple.

All an individual has to do is click the microphone button located on the bottom of their screen and they will be muted.

## Part 3: How to Mute Someone in Google Meet?

There are times when individuals are not aware that the background noise of their surroundings is causing a disturbance in the meeting. That is when muting someone can come in handy! Basically in this, a host or other participants in the meeting can mute an individual based on need. However, there is an eligibility criterion they must adhere to in order to get the muting permissions.

### The Eligibility Criteria To Mute Someone in Google Meet

Before looking into **how to mute someone on Google Meet**, check if any of the following scenarios apply to you,

* During video calls that are hosted through personal Google accounts, only the moderator can mute a person.
* Google Meet calls made through Google workspace accounts only permit a person, from the domain which organized the meeting, to mute a participant.
* During a video call arranged by using an educational Google account, only the individual who has created the meeting / is the owner of a calendar can mute other individuals.

So, if any of these circumstances apply to you, then you can easily mute someone in a Google Meet session. The process involves the following steps,

Click onto a participant’s picture and click Mute or if this step is not working for you, then at the bottom right of your video room on Google Meet, click people , once you do that a menu will appear on the side of your screen.

Click on the arrow next to the name of the person you would like to mute. Once you do that, a drop-down menu will appear with three options.
