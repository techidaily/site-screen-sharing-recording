**Step 2: Start the Recording**

During an ongoing meeting session, click the **More actions** icon from the top-right area of the **Meeting with** box, and click **Start recording** from the menu that comes down next to start the recording.

**Step 3: Enable Automatic Recording**

On the **Meeting options** page, turn on the **Record automatically** switch. Once this is done, you can safely share the invitation link with the people you want to attend the meeting, and Teams will start the recording as soon as the first participant joins in.

## Part 5: How to Record Teams Meeting Secretly?

One such program is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare.
