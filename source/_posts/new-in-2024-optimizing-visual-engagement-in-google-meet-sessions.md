## Part 4: How to Change Your Background On Google Meet On Android/iOS Before Meeting?

To change the background in Google Meet on Android or iOS, you need to have Android / iOS devices which support the feature; the devices are listed below.

Some Android devices which work exceptionally well with Google Meet backgrounds include the Samsung Galaxy S9, Pixel 3, as well as other similar devices. On the split side, if you are an iOS user then opt for an iPhone 8 or latest version, an iPad 5th Generation or later, or any Apple device which has iOS 12 or above.

Tip: In some cases you might get cropped out due to your background, to avoid that, you will need to turn it off. Also, if your device has a low battery, you might want to turn your background off, to make your battery last longer.

Just as you are allowed to change your background on Google Meet on desktop, similarly you can change it on a mobile device. The process is fairly simple too. The steps outlined below are for Android as well as iOS.

1. Open the Google Meet application on your device. Before joining the meeting on your device click the “Effects” icon, you will find it near the bottom of your screen on self-view. With effects, you can alter the lighting during your call to create a more clear ambiance.
2. Don’t want to let your colleagues to where you are at and remain professional at the same time? Google Meet has got you covered! You can blur the background now! To use the pre-built backgrounds, tap the background you would like to use from the given options. There are numerous options ranging from professional workspaces to a beachside view!

## Part 5: How to Change Your Google Meet Background On Android / iOS During A Meeting?

Whether it is a work meeting or a fun video call with your colleagues - you can adjust your background accordingly to create a better setting for yourself and eliminate all extra elements from your background.

If you have [recorded the Google Meet video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and want to change the video background, then you should try Wondershare Filmora. The Human Segmentation effect under AI Portrait will isolate the people from the video background, and [remove the background even without a green screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and later you can add a new video background.

Check the video tutorial below to find out more details, and download to try Wondershare Filmora for free.
