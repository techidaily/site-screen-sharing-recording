2. **Integrated Video Conferencing tools** – where the [camera and equipment](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are in the conference center. Like a lecture.
3. **Telepresence** – Video conferencing tools that use telepresence to mimic human interaction as closely as possible. A digital presence, if you will.
4. **[Desktop Video Conferencing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** are the ones we are most familiar with. We all use our devices to connect to one single group video chat.
5. **Room based Video conferencing frameworks using Codec** – a video conferencing tool that is best used when someone needs to communicate with a whole room while they are moving around.
6. **Service Based** – this type of online video conferencing tool is rarely free and requires your internet service provider to do the majority of the organization on your behalf.
