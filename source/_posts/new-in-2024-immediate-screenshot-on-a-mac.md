### Tip 1. Mac OS Keyboard shortcut screenshots

• To print screen on mac (the entire screen), press \[COMMAND\] + \[SHIFT\] + 3

• To screenshot a portion of your screen, press \[COMMAND\] + \[SHIFT\] + 4; notice the cursor changes into a crosshair pointer; move the crosshair pointer where you want the screenshot to begin and drag to select; to adjust, hold \[SHIFT\], \[OPTION\] or \[SPACE BAR\] while you drag

For more advanced Mac screenshot applications, including the capability to edit, caption, and export to a variety of formats, you will need a more powerful screen capture tool to help you in taking a screenshot.

These applications can help you improve your screen captures and recordings with advanced tools and professional capabilities.
