Responsive Screen Recording - When you capture the screen with Adobe Captive, the recorded video is going to be responsive so that any user can view the video of any device seamlessly. It is quite similar to creating responsive websites that adjust as per screen size for proper display.

Capture Everything - Apart from capturing screen activities, the software captures all mouse movements, keyboard activities as well as system sound to clear the video as much perfectly as possible.

Standard Editing - Adobe screen capture software lets you edit the recorded video to add transitions, insert texts and images, draw smart shapes and highlight boxes, add voiceover and audio effects. You can add another video in Picture-in-Picture format, and you can publish your recorded and edited video on YouTube with a single click. Besides, you can add pan and zoom effects, trim video clips, and split video into different sections.
