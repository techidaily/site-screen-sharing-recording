## Part 1\. Free Ways to Record Mac Screen with Audio

Before getting to more advanced tools, it's better to go through a couple of free screen and audio recorders that you can use.

### Use QuickTime Player

If you are using a Mac, you must have used QuickTime Player to watch media. It's a tool that has multiple functions rather than just a player. It comes preinstalled on all the Macs and you will not need to pay any amount to unlock its features.

Users will get to record the screen along with mic and system audio using this tool and while you are on it, you should know that it is just a recorder and not an editor. The interface that you will get is highly intuitive and user friendly where the recording process is extremely simple and straightforward.

How to record?

* Once everything is set, it's time to hit the Record button and it will give you a drag & drop tool to make the screen selection. If you want to record the full screen, all you need to do is click anywhere on the screen to start recording.
* To select a specific area, you will need to drag and drop from any corner of the screen.

### Use Screenshot Toolbar
