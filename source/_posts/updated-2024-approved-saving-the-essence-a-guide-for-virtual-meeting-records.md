### 1\. Record Teams Meeting on Desktop/Laptop

Once you are sure that all the prerequisites that are listed above are met, you can go through the following instructions to learn **how to record a Teams meeting** on a computer:

**Step 1: Start a Teams Video Call**

Launch Microsoft Teams on your PC (a Windows 10 laptop here). On the main interface, make sure that the **Chat** option is selected in the pane on the left. Then, click **Video** **Call** (the **Camcorder** icon) from the top-right area of the **Chat** pane.

## Part 2: How to Automatically Record Microsoft Teams Meetings?

Quite recently, Microsoft integrated a new feature to the Teams app that allows the organizers to automatically record all the meeting sessions that take place. The recording starts automatically as soon as the first participant joins a meeting. This automatic recording function can be easily turned off if the organizer wants to.

You can learn **how to record a Teams meeting** automatically by following the instructions that are given below:

**Step 1: Get to the Meeting with Box**

Launch Microsoft Teams on your computer, and use the method explained earlier to get to the **Meeting with** box by initiating a new meeting.

**Step 2: Get to the Meeting options Page**

When on the **Meeting with** box, click **Join now** to start a new meeting, click the **Show participants** icon from the upper-right area, and when the **Participants** box comes up, click **Manage permissions**.

**Step 3: Enable Automatic Recording**

On the **Meeting options** page, turn on the **Record automatically** switch. Once this is done, you can safely share the invitation link with the people you want to attend the meeting, and Teams will start the recording as soon as the first participant joins in.

## Part 3: How to Find Recorded Meetings in Teams?

The recorded files of the Teams meetings are saved to SharePoint in case of a channel meeting, or to the ‘Recordings’ folder on OneDrive if it was any other type of meeting. The processes of locating the Teams meeting files are given below:

**For Channel Meetings**

* Launch Microsoft Teams
* Click to select the **Files** option from the left pane
* Click to select **Microsoft Teams** from the **Files** pane
* Locate the recorded meeting from the window on the right

* Locate and right-click the meeting file that you want to share
* Click **Share** from the context menu
* Use the **Share** box that opens next to add the participants you want to access the recorded file
* Click **Send** to start sharing

## Part 5: How to Record Teams Meeting Secretly?

Although Microsoft made Teams quite transparent by sending notifications to all the attendees as soon as you start recording a meeting, sometimes you may not want this to happen. In such a case, you must rely on a third-party app that can record your computer screen behind the scenes.

One such program is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare. Although Wondershare Filmora is primarily used for industry-standard post-product tasks such as video editing, apply effects and filters to the motion clips, etc., it offers the option to [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam, and audio as additional features so you don’t have to depend on any other software for screencasting.
