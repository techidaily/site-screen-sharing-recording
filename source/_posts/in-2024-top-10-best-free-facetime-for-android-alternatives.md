[Video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allow us to keep in touch with our friends and family during these difficult times without jeopardizing anyone’s safety.

The app’s been labeled as Android’s official response to FaceTime, as it allows its users to receive calls even if they don’t have it installed on their phones.

Google Duo allows you to organize group calls with up to **12 participants**  or send video, audio or text messages. Sharing photos or making voice calls through Google Duo are also some of the options you will have if you decide to use this video chat app.

### 2. JusTalk

![ FaceTime Alternative: Skype for iPhone  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-for-iphone-talk-chat-collaborate.jpg)

At the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic, the number of Skype’s users increased by 70% in a single month. This statistic alone speaks volumes about the app’s popularity, as millions of people choose to talk to their business associates or friends through Skype.

Besides being one of the most popular [cross-platform video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ever created, Skype is also remarkably easy to use, as you just need a webcam and a microphone to start a video call.

All Skype to Skype calls are free while calling landlines, mobile phones, or sending messages is only possible if you purchase Skype credit. Furthermore, the app offers the group call feature, although a single group call cannot have more than **24 participants.**

### 4. Snapchat

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android&hl=en), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370)

![ FaceTime Alternative: Snapchat  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-video-chat.jpg)

With a user base of more than 210 million people, Snapchat is easily one of the best video chat apps for Android and iPhones. Besides giving you the option to video chat with 16 friends at the same time, Snapchat also offers the possibility to send video snaps or photos that disappear just seconds after you sent them to all of your contacts.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it. Doodling over the video while the call is still in progress, applying or creating photo and video filters and discovering where your friends hang out are just a few among countless options Snapchat provides.

WhatsApp features an impressive collection of GIFs and emojis that make all your conversations more entertaining, and you can also use the app to take photos or record voice messages. WhatsApp lets its users create groups that can have up to 256 members, which makes it easy to communicate with large numbers of people at the same time.

![ FaceTime Alternative:  Viber Messenger ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viber-messenger-for-ios.jpg)

In addition to making video calls to your friends who are also using this app, you can also install Viber Out if you want to use this app to call mobile phones and landlines.

Furthermore, you can make group calls with up to 20 participants on Viber, although you must have Viber 10 or a newer version of the app in order to participate in group calls. The ability to send instant voice and video messages or quickly switch between video and audio calls are also the advantages you will have if you choose to install Viber on your Smartphone.
