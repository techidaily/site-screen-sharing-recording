## Part 5: Best Snap Camera Filters and Lens for Zoom Meetings

To make your Zoom meetings a bit funny, you can choose from a plethora of Snapchat camera filters. You can apply these lenses to your Zoom meeting and have some fun. Since there are many filters to go for, we have curated a list of the best Snap Camera filters that you can save as your favorite in the Snap Camera app. Here they are:

### 1\.  The Potato Lens

![ best Snap Camera lens and filters - potato](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-potato-lens.jpg)

The most popular Snap Camera filter is the potato lens. Phil Walton has created this filter. Once you use it, you will find yourself underground, and your face will be replaced by a potato. However, the potato will have your eyes and mouth. To search for this filter, use the search bar and search for potato.

### 2\.  Cat Filters

Another funny or rather an adorable filter to try is the cat filter. There is a multitude of cat filters available. You can check out the one that you like the most and try it out. This filter became popular after an awkward incident occurred during a virtual legal proceeding, where the advocate turned on the cat filter and appeared as a cat.

### 3\.  Cute Puppy Lens

Peter Studio has created the cute puppy lens. It won't really change you to a puppy, but the filter will add puppy ears on top of your head with an adorable puppy nose.

### 4\.  Donut Glasses Lens

![ best Snap Camera lens and filters - donuts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snap-camera-donuts-lens.jpg)

Another one that will turn any boring meeting into a daytime party is the donut glasses filter. Two donuts will appear on your eyes, and the background will change to pink frosting with yellow and green sprinkles.

### 5\.  Park at the Beach Lens

![ Snap Camera lens and filters - beach](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snap-camera-beach-lens.jpg)

Here's another one to try. If you are missing the beach, try the park at the beach lens. This lens is created by Pedro Cruz. It will make you look like you are at the beach.
