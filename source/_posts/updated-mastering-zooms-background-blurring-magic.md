## **Part 1: What to Consider Before Blurring the Background in Zoom?**

#### 2 – Update Zoom to get the Blur Background

Ensure that the computer system is up to date and supports the latest version of Zoom. To check for updates, tap your profile picture of your **Zoom Desktop Client** at the top-right corner, then scroll down and tap where it says "**Check for Updates**."

If you've already downloaded the latest version, restart your computer and open Zoom again to see if it shows up.

#### 3 – Check Your Computer Requirements

Alternatively, you can check for Client and processor requirements. All the information related to requirements compatibility is available on the Zoom help page for virtual background requirements.

To check the compatibility, go to "**Backgrounds and Filters**" and uncheck the box that says "**I have a green screen**" under "**Virtual Backgrounds**."

Next, hover over your list of virtual backgrounds. In case you get an error message pointing you need a green screen to support virtual backgrounds, your computer doesn't support the blur background feature.

Now, click on the Effects panel. Choose the "Background Blur" option and go with your desired blur effect. Filters such as Mosaic, Diamonds, or Grey will elicit a visually pleasing background for your portrait video.

**Step 3: After applying the effect, adjust the blur level by double-clicking over the timeline.**

Modify the background color, luminance, source width, scale level, Alpha for the blurry background.
