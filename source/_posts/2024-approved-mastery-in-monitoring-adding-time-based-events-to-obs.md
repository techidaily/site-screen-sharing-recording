## Mastery in Monitoring: Adding Time-Based Events to OBS

OBS Studio is arguably the best free, open-source screen recorder for Mac, Windows, and Linux computers. It packs powerful features that make screen recording fun, engaging, and convenient. But in this guidepost, we’ll dwell on the little-known **OBS countdown timer**.

So, what is the OBS Studio countdown timer, and why do you need to make one? This article discusses that and how to add a countdown timer overlay to your local videos using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Let’s dig in!

## Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?

You probably don’t need a further introduction to a countdown timer if you’re often watching action movies or marking calendars. But clear doubts, a countdown timer is basically the remaining time in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds before a start of an event. A good example is those James Bond movies where a bomb has, let’s say, 60 seconds before exploding.

With that said, you can use the **OBS timer countdown** in multiple ways. For example, you can use it to pump up excitement before a much anticipated live streaming session starts. Remember that OBS Studio supports live streaming to popular platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.

![obs countdown timer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-1.jpg)

So, the timer will tell viewers the duration they’ll have to wait before the next live session. You can even add an action text after the timer ends. A countdown timer can also help you ensure that the viewer sticks around until the end of an event or video.

Picture this; you can be a fitness trainer on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, etc. In that case, you’ll need to perform each set of exercises for a specific duration, then rest for like 30 or 60 seconds.

So, add a timer to the video to guide the trainees throughout the session. This helps make the session more engaging and fun. Whichever the reasons you have to add an **OBS count down timer**, the objective is simple; communicate to the viewers the time left before an event starts or ends.

## Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS

Up to this point, you might think that adding an OBS countdown clock is such a complicated task. After all, OBS isn’t the most beginner-friendly screen recorder to use. But don’t fret because adding a countdown timer is one of the most straightforward things to do in OBS Studio. Let’s do that!

Step1 Fire up OBS Studio and select a recording scene on which you want to apply the countdown timer. Once the scene is ready, tap the Plus button on the Sources section, then select the Text Source. Now give the source a name. For instance, you can name it Timer.

![obs countdown timer add a text source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-2.jpg)

Step2 Now you’ll see a pop-up window to customize how the timer will look. For example, click the Select font button to customize the font settings for the countdown timer. You can also customize things like opacity, gradient, background color, alignment, and more.

![obs countdown timer customize timer details](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-3.jpg)

Step3 Next, click the Tools tab and then tap Scripts. Then, select the countdown.lua file and customize the countdown descriptions on the pop-up window. You can change the countdown duration and the final text after the countdown. Don’t also forget to select Timer as the Text Source. The OBS countdown timer will immediately start counting.

## Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer

You’ll definitely need precise timing to get the most out of the **timer countdown on OBS**. Also, sometimes you can record a video on your smartphone or camera and customize it with a countdown timer. If that’s the case, consider using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

It’s a professional-grade video editor for macOS and Windows systems that allows you to add countdown timer overlays to any video. Unlike OBS, this method will enable you to add timer overlays to specific scenes on the footage, including the intro part. Even best is that the countdown timers come in multiple styles, and you can customize the timer with appropriate background audio.
