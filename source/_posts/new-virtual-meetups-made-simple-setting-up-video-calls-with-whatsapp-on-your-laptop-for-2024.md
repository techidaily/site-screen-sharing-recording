We are wondering how to make video calls in [WhatsApp web](https://web.whatsapp.com/) on laptops instead of on phones? It can be done, we promise! We took a look to try and explain this one a little further after we found out that not everyone knows how it all works.

WhatsApp is one of our favorite communication apps, especially useful while we are all stuck at home in shelter of the virus. While [social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) ensues, apps like this one are increasingly important. However, not all of us know how to make WhatsApp calls from a PC – and that’s why we are here!

* [**Part 2: How to Make Video Call from WhatsApp Web in Laptop**](#how-to-make-video-call-whatsapp-laptop)
* [**Part 3: WhatsApp Web alternative**](#WhatsApp-Web-alternative)

## Part 1: Can You Make Video Calls on WhatsApp Desktop

Unfortunately, you can’t use WhatsApp on the desktop to make video calls directly. However, you can use another third-party software to emulate the WhatsApp video call on desktop. In addition to video calls, you can use other features like on the phone.

Anyone asking, “how can I make a video call on WhatsApp Web?” is in the right place.

## Part 2: How to Make Video Call from WhatsApp Web in Laptop

Everyone who has done a little research will see that you can use WhatsApp Web to make calls and send messages. At first glance, it appears as though the controls are the same, but you are more limited in options because you can’t, seemingly, make video calls.

What you need is an Emulator. This clever little piece of tech was first invented to do things like playing retro video games through a modern pc. The emulator connects the missing encryptions between the two technologies. In the case of a product called [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/), it will allow you to run WhatsApp as if it were on your phone, but do it through your computer.

All you need to do is follow these instructions, and you will be making video calls in WhatsApp web in a laptop in no time!

In a few easy steps:

   1. Download an emulator – [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) is considered an industry favorite at the moment.
   2. Select Save, then run the application. Give it time to install.
   3. Set up your account with the app and log in to Google to sync.

![set Bluestacks account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-bluestacks-account.png)

   1. Find WhatsApp in the Play or Apple store and download it.

![download WhatsApp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-whatsapp-in-bluestacks.JPG)

   1. Open it through the Bluestacks and set the WhatsApp with the same account on your phone.

![log in whatsapp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-whatsapp-in-desktop.JPG)

1. Now you can see all your contacts on WhatsApp, and you can also add more people here.
2. Choose a friend to start a conversation, and then tap the video call button at the top right corner. The whole process is easy to complete like on the phone.

Your WhatsApp download will run from here, giving you the answer to how to make video calls in WhatsApp web – on laptops.

## Part 3: WhatsApp Web Alternative

There are 3 WhatsApp Web Alternatives that we can think of, off the top of our heads.

### 1\. [Skype Online](https://www.skype.com/en/features/skype-web/)

Skype is one of the longest-running video calling and web calling apps. It gives you a local international ID to make long-distance calls for free, and much easier. It also has some great functions if you need to work from home or video conference. Skype has excellent customer support and some wonderful add-ons to make the experience more accessible. When it comes to a tailored, professional finish, then Skype has the most experience. You can also [record Skype video call](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) easily.

![Skype](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype.JPG)

### 2\. [Google Duo](https://duo.google.com/about/)

If you can’t figure out how to make video calls on WhatsApp Web on laptops, then Google Duo is a brilliant alternative. It allows HD video and audio chat while working with low bandwidth or bad Wi-Fi. It’s fully compatible with all things made by Google – and it works by signing into your Google account, so your friends don’t need to do very much if you invite them to a call.

![Google Duo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-duo-app.JPG)

### 3\. [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/)

If you don’t intend to do much in the way of group chatting, then video calling in Messenger is a reliable way to see friends during the lockdown. Most people have Facebook, it will work with all their products, and it is as easy to join as clicking a link. The downside is that it only works if FB knows who you are. If you closed your account with them, then you will need to start from scratch. That being said, audio and video are both clear, you can add in file sharing, and you have the option to instant message at all times. Plus, it will sync with your contacts in much the same way as Google Duo will.

![Facebook Messenger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/messenger-app.JPG)

## Rounding Up

So if you can’t work out how to make a WhatsApp call from a PC, try one of our other recommendations for keeping in touch. WhatsApp is a wonderfully secure, encrypted messaging service – but it isn’t the only one on the market. It might not even be the right product for you.
