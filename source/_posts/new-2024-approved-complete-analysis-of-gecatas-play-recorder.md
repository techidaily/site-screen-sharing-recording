## Part 2: How to Use Gecata to Record Games

Movavi Gecata is a relatively new continuing interaction recording program that costs just $19.95 and has all of the features that gamers want. PC games are more well-known than they have ever been, and players are eager to document their interactions. Some people have to transmit to their friends, while some do it professionally as Twitch or YouTube decorations. Regardless of the intended use, make sure you think about Gecata in light of the surrounding reality of interest.

**Step 1: Download and install Gecata by Movavi**

After the download is complete, launch the.exe file and follow the Installation Wizard's instructions. It will just take a few seconds to finish the interaction. When it's finished, open the program and capture whatever gameplay footage you need.

**Step 2: Modify the Capture Options**

Make sure the Capture mode in the main window is set to Game. The noises of the framework will be picked up on their own. If you need to capture your voice and face while you're playing, enable the Microphone and Webcam on the Devices page.

**Step 3: Take a video of the game**

If you need to start recording after dispatching the game, click Start Recording in the application interface before starting the game; otherwise, start the game you want to record. To start or stop recording, use F10, and to stop, press F9\. You don't need to do anything; the game film will be stored on your hard disk as an MP4 file as a result. This is how to record games on a computer, and it couldn't be much easier!

**Step 4: Save your Gameplay**

Change the Video quality slider to choose the output video quality. Note that high-quality game footage will take up a lot of space on your computer, so make sure you have at least 2 or 3 GB of free space before you start filming. Simply click the Capture distinct streams box to save the screen capture and camera recordings as separate documents.

The user interface is simple, yet it's functional and easy to navigate. You may record any game in 4K ultra-HD resolution, whether it's a 2D or 3D game. It also has editing capabilities, making it one of the most popular games recording programs available. Likewise, it is membership-based, which is unusual in the game catch software industry, so you should think about it. We recommend [Filmora video recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as one choice. Whatever you want to record, whether it's gaming, web player videos, continuing commentary, music, or anything else.

Furthermore, since the finest games are found on Windows PCs, the best screen recorder for games will almost always be Windows PC software. Filmora, on the other hand, is accessible for the two phases in the event of an incident. Filmora allows you to record the whole screen, a specific location, your camera, or even just a small zone around your mouse, and it outputs in all of the major formats, including MP4\. The implicit manager allows you to add text, lines, call-outs, and other on-screen elements, which is useful if you want to create an educational exercise rather than merely record your continuing interaction.
