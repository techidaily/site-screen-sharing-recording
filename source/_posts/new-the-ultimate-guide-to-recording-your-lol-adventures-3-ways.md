![lol-built-in-function](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lol-built-in-function.png)

Using League of Legends' built-in replay function is the easiest way to record the game. You can also download it separately. A replay button will appear after your match has ended. You can click on this button to watch the replay of your match, and you can also download the replay and save it to your device if you want to. In our opinion, it is the best and most convenient way to record your gameplay because, in this case, you don't need to download any software separately. Everything is built-in here. All you need to do is just play the game and leave the rest to the replay function.

Here is the process for recording gameplay through the built-in method:

* After you start a game, wait until it is over.
* Click on the download button after the match ends. It is situated alongside "Advanced Options" at the top of the screen.
* Wait for a few seconds. This file will be saved in your League of Legends highlights folder.

#### **2\. Using Filmora Screen Recording Option**

You can download the latest version of Filmora (Filmora X) from the official website of Wondershare and start using it for free.

#### **3\. Using DemoCreator**

![dc-record-lol](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dc-record-lol.png)

If you want to record your LOL gameplay to share it on YouTube or other video-sharing platforms, then you should know that the quality of your video matters a lot. So, we will share software using which you can record your gameplay at the highest video settings.

This can be accomplished using the Wondershare DemoCreator software. You can also record high-resolution games at up to 120 frames per second. You can use multiple audio, video, microphones, and webcams at the same time. In addition, you can select a specific portion of the screen or the entire screen. Videos can be sped up or slowed down easily.

Users can also add Fade-ins and fade-outs. Your own narration can be added during editing. During editing, it is also possible to remove audio. The sensitive scenes can also be blurred to eliminate them. Likewise, the watermark can be removed from the scene. To summarize, DemoCreator is an easy-to-use tool that records gameplay in a much more efficient manner.

The process of the recording consists of the following steps:

* To get started, click the Get Started option within the app. Adjust your audio settings, the size of your recording clips, and your webcam, among other things. A recording can also be made with the default option of Quick Capture.
* In the next step, you'll be asked whether you want to record the game. Select the game option. You can choose to capture the full screen or to capture a customized section of the screen. The frame rate can be adjusted (up to 120 fps).

You can choose either 1080p or 720p as your recording resolution. In the next step, choose the frame rate at which you want your camera to record.
* You can choose here where you want your recordings saved after you have chosen advanced. There are a variety of encoders available, including Fast JPG or AVC. It is also possible to set hotkeys for this.
* Select the Capture option after making all the necessary settings. It's time to start the recording. You can adjust the recording settings according to your preferences.
