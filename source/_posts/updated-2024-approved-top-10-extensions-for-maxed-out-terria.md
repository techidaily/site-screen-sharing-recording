Mining in Terraria using clicks of the mouse can be very painful because you have to destroy each block made up of several bricks. Veinminer can help to reduce your hard work. It is a simple and easy-to-use mod that enables you to destroy the entire vein of bricks just by hitting a chunk of bricks. With a single hit of the vein of bricks, the entire chunk of the similar brick will vanish. It seems like cheating but as you know Terraria is all about clicking and clicking is king. So it will save you a lot of time and effort of clicking each brick of the Terraria.

**Features**

* Mine in the Terraria more easily
* Destroy the entire chunk of blocks in one click
* Save your time and clicks

Several NPCs are available in this mode to sell you various items to help your progress. The items include wood, lumberjack, simple materials, boss summoning trinkets, and much more.

#### [10\. Boss Checklist](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/boss-checklist-in-game-progression-checklist.50668/)

![boss-checklist-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boss-checklist-poster.jpg)

Playing Terraria and adding several mods at a time can be very confusing. Terraria already contains a wide range of bosses, and after adding mods, the number of bosses increases to a very large scale. This will make it hard for you to have in mind what you have accomplished and what you have to accomplish next. This Boss Checklist mod will be beneficial in that case. It will provide you with an in-game list of all the bosses and activities you have achieved and have to achieve. It almost supports all kinds of mods which makes it one of the best Terraria mods. However, if you have added a small mod, it might not support Boss Checklist because it depends upon the permission provided by each mod to Boss Checklist to access the progress.

**Features**

* Keep record of everything you do
* Check what you have accomplished
* Check what you have to accomplish
* Keep record of every boss you kill
