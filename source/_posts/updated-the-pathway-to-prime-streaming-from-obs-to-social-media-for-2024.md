Using this will enable you to represent a certain scenario throughout a historical period. Nesting sceneries enable you to edit one portion of a scene without having to go through the full scenario. OBS Studio takes your web camera, microphone, and other devices as inputs and works well on all Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. It has a big community, which assures a steady supply of filters, transition effects, overlays, and help if you ever have trouble when working the program.

## Part 1: How to Set up OBS Stream Settings

OBS Studio provides several wonderful tools for beginner broadcasters who are just getting the swing of live broadcasting. The program contains a set of OBS-specific system requirements to guarantee the most optimum live broadcasting experience. These options include the ability to mix several sources with unique transitions, employ audio/video filters and correction tools, and more. First, access the OBS Studio settings by selecting the “Settings” button in the bottom-right region of the program window. The first tab, named “General,” doesn’t include anything particularly significant to examine. However, here, you may pick your language and choose a bright or dark theme.

### Steps to Set up OBS Stream Settings

****Step 1:** Once you’ve evaluated these options, click on the next tab labeled “Stream” in the OBS Studio settings box. Game capture is suggested for live streaming since it is designed for recording screen material as well as capturing video.
