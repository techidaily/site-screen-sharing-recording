Step 2: Adjust the recording window

There are three window types to consider: Custom, Fullscreen, and Target.

Its user interface gives you total control over your project, including the ability to change your timeline.

Step 3: Custom the settings

You may choose a full-screen mode from the custom menu to capture your screen activity in the highest quality possible. For the upcoming Screen casting sessions, you may modify the settings here. The Screen Recorder allows you to capture video and audio.

Step 4: Record your screen
