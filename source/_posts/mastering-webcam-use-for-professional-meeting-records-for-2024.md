## The Bottom Line

Hopefully, you have understood how do you record a PowerPoint with a webcam. You can do it using PowerPoint's inbuilt recording option as well as using an online recording tool. In both these methods, you do not need any external software but they have certain shortcomings. Hence, we recommend you Wondershare Filmora to record PPT with webcam and edit it before sharing and publishing on any platform.
