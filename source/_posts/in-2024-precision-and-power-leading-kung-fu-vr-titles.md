#### **Meaning of sifu**

To begin with, many of you might wonder the right way to say the word "sifu." It is pronounced as "sea fool" rather than "sign fool." By the way, "sifu" means master in Chinese/Cantonese, especially in the martial art field and some craftsmanship field. For example, you can call the teacher who teaches you to make perfect ramen a "sifu."
