Quite recently, Microsoft integrated a new feature to the Teams app that allows the organizers to automatically record all the meeting sessions that take place.

The recorded files of the Teams meetings are saved to SharePoint in case of a channel meeting, or to the ‘Recordings’ folder on OneDrive if it was any other type of meeting. The processes of locating the Teams meeting files are given below:

## Part 5: How to Record Teams Meeting Secretly?

Although Microsoft made Teams quite transparent by sending notifications to all the attendees as soon as you start recording a meeting, sometimes you may not want this to happen. In such a case, you must rely on a third-party app that can record your computer screen behind the scenes.

One such program is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare. Although Wondershare Filmora is primarily used for industry-standard post-product tasks such as video editing, apply effects and filters to the motion clips, etc., it offers the option to [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam, and audio as additional features so you don’t have to depend on any other software for screencasting.

**Q2) Who can start or stop a recording of a Teams meeting?**

**A2)** The organizer of the meeting or a person from the same organization can start or stop the recording.

**Q3) Will people know if I start a recording on Teams meeting?**

**A3)** Yes. If you are using the Teams’ built-in recording feature to record a meeting, all the attendees will be notified about it. If you don’t want anyone to know that you are recording a session, you can use an efficient third-party app like Wondershare Filmora, and follow the steps explained earlier to learn **how to record Teams meeting** behind the scenes.
