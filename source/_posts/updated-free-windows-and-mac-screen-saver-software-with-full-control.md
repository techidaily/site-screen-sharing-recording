Screen recording is an extremely efficient way to present something to an audience (especially for a novice audience) precisely on both Windows and Mac. It wipes away all the doubts and difficulties. Filmora is the best software to resolve the headache that users may not find a suitable tool to help them record their screen. With all-in-one features, users not only can record videos, but they also can edit recordings with a powerful editing suite.

Filmora is free to use and there is no limitation in recording time, but there will be a watermark in the exported video. To remove the watermark, you can purchase Filmora's license.

#### 2. [Jing](http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html)

Jing is a free screen recorder presented by TechSmith. It is a small but powerful tool that comes with essentials which allows you to capture images as well as videos and share to the Internet. Although Jing doesn’t have high end features, it is effective enough to plan, record and share the video within a very small time.

Being a free software, Jing still is backed up with the technical support of the TechSmith. However, Jing is not the best software tool for you when it comes to big projects, and you have to sign up and connect to your TechSmith account to use. Besides, as a free screen recording software, Jing allows you to capture screens up to five minutes and the best frame rate is 10FPS, and the recorded videos will be saved in SWF flash format. So, before downloading this free screen recorder on your Windows PC or Mac computer, make sure if you are OK with that.
