Creating a GIF file with Gyazo is a straightforward process that takes a minimum amount of time and effort.

The free version of the app doesn't offer any editing tools, but if you upgrade to Pro or Team plans you'll be able to add annotations to your files or use the app without having to deal with ads. Up to five different people can use the Team plan, and it allows you to share files privately with the team.

Select the Capture GIF option in the software's main window and then designate the area of your screen you'd like to turn into a GIF. After the screen recording session, you can edit the file by adding text elements or drawing with a free hand.

Gyazo provides powerful file-sharing options, and it enables you to share your animated GIF files with a single click.
