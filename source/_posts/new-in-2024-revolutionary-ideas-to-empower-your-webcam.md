#### 3. Use for Home Surveillance

Everyone wants additional security in the living premises and public places as well.

They work perfectly with the latest motion detection software and can activate sensor-based monitoring 24x7\. The surprising fact is that these webcams can even record infrared light movements that are otherwise invisible to human eyes. Hence, they are the best solution for night time monitoring.
