## Ultimate PlayTracker Insight

It's futile to look for another game recorder now that the Gecata game recorder is here. However, it'll be much better if you can share that fantastic experience with the rest of the globe, right? In the end, game recording software may let you do just that. It doesn't matter whether you're playing Minecraft or a shooting game; being able to share your knowledge with a large group of people is always impressive. Furthermore, the cycle has become much easier for players as a result of the accelerating innovation. You may record a full-screen continuing interaction at 60 frames per second with Gecata by Movavi and save it as an MP4 movie with recommended configurations for YouTube transmission.

Gecata is a good and maybe the best option for Windows users looking for a lightweight but very functional game recording program. It also ensures a single tick, which is a slack-free action that enables you to broadcast and record at the same time. Individual hotkeys are included, allowing you to explore your game without being interrupted. It also allows you to capture videos in 4K at 120 frames per second, which is rather impressive for a gadget of this sort. Add sound from speakers and a mouthpiece to your interaction accounts, as well as webcam video, so you can share your emotions with viewers when you upload the video to YouTube or another video-sharing platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Gecata to Record Games

Movavi Gecata is a relatively new continuing interaction recording program that costs just $19.95 and has all of the features that gamers want. PC games are more well-known than they have ever been, and players are eager to document their interactions. Some people have to transmit to their friends, while some do it professionally as Twitch or YouTube decorations. Regardless of the intended use, make sure you think about Gecata in light of the surrounding reality of interest.

**Step 1: Download and install Gecata by Movavi**

After the download is complete, launch the.exe file and follow the Installation Wizard's instructions. It will just take a few seconds to finish the interaction. When it's finished, open the program and capture whatever gameplay footage you need.

**Step 2: Modify the Capture Options**

Make sure the Capture mode in the main window is set to Game. The noises of the framework will be picked up on their own. If you need to capture your voice and face while you're playing, enable the Microphone and Webcam on the Devices page.

**Step 3: Take a video of the game**

If you need to start recording after dispatching the game, click Start Recording in the application interface before starting the game; otherwise, start the game you want to record. To start or stop recording, use F10, and to stop, press F9\. You don't need to do anything; the game film will be stored on your hard disk as an MP4 file as a result. This is how to record games on a computer, and it couldn't be much easier!

**Step 4: Save your Gameplay**

Change the Video quality slider to choose the output video quality. Note that high-quality game footage will take up a lot of space on your computer, so make sure you have at least 2 or 3 GB of free space before you start filming. Simply click the Capture distinct streams box to save the screen capture and camera recordings as separate documents.

## Part 3: Pros and Cons

Gecata supports a variety of codecs, makes use of NVIDIA and Intel hardware acceleration, and can record 4K video at up to 120 frames per second. Because the audio streams are saved independently, it's simple to cut out any bloopers without disrupting the in-game audio.
