## Way 2\. Use Dacast

Dacast is an extremely popular platform for organizing live stream conference and meeting. Apart from live streaming, you can host your video on the platform as well as monetize your video to earn revenue. Most importantly, you can record your live stream video conference so that the audiences can re-watch them at any future instance. You can record video up to six hours at a time. Here are the steps to record your live stream video on Dacast.

Step 1: Create a live channel on Dacast and set the following settings so that recording works perfectly.

Video Codex –

Audio Codec – ACC

Live Channel Status - On

Step 2: Go to General section and turn on Live Stream Recording option. Once you turn it on, the recording will be automatic in the background once you start live streaming your video.

![decast live channel status](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/decast-live-channel-status.jpg)

The recording option stays activated for seven days. Thereafter, you have to activate it again from General section.

Step 3: The recording will stop automatically as soon as you stop your live stream. If you want to stop recording in between, you have to disable the recording option and save VOD file. You can find the recorded video under “Video on Demand” option.

It is important to note that you can record Dacast live stream video only if you are the creator of the video. It is not possible for a viewer to record with Dacast and the viewer needs to use a dedicated screen recorder.

## Way 3\. Record with Restream

Restream is another popular live streaming platform and you can live stream your video on almost all the popular online live streaming websites. If you are using Restream to live stream video, you can record your video as well. First of all, Restream Studio automatically records your live stream videos as soon as you go live.

When your live stream gets over, you will get to download in your hard drive as well as export the recording to cloud storage platforms. Apart from that, there is a Record-only Mode that also lets you record your video on Restream. Here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Open Restream Studio.

Step 2: Click on Record Only option on the home screen.

![restream record only option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/restream-record-only-option.jpg)

Step 3: Provide a label for the recording session so that you can find it easily. Click on Enter Studio button.
