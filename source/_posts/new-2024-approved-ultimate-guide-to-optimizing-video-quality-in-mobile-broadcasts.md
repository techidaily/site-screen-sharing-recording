OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software) is an application that allows you to record your video games and broadcast yourself over the Internet using sites such as the popular Twitch TV. You don't have a dedicated webcam or costly streaming camera? Whatever your purpose may be, you simply wish to employ your Android mobile phones or tablet computer's built-in camera using Open Broadcaster Software

Since live streaming is creating more noise today than ever, a lot of us are looking for a trustworthy option for OBS to enhance the beauty of their video in terms of usefulness. You need to download an app that mirrors your phone’s screen to your PC, and then you can window capture the PC component of that program using OBS. There may be an app from the phone manufacturer, and a free open-source screen capture program for Android phones.
