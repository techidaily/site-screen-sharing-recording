#### 1. The Top Webcam for Twitch Streaming: Logitech C920

![Logitech C920 Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-c920.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

The [Logitech C920](https://amzn.to/3LhILGe) is considered by most Twitch streamers to be the best all-around cameras for streaming. It is **cost-effective**, **very reliable,** and offers **the best image quality for its price range.** Although the C920 doesn’t have a few of the add-ons the C922 has, you can be confident that you’re still getting a fantastic camera. It excels at all the basic requirements, with **impressive video quality** **at 1080p**.

While there are a lot of other webcams that can stream 1080p HD videos, most can only stream in 1080p at the cost of a lowered frame rate. The footage they produce will be high-resolution, but the video will appear sluggish. What really sets Logitech’s C920 apart is its ability to stream 1080p video with a **framerate of 30 FPS** with no framerate reduction.

If you are looking for the best bang for your buck, the C920 is the one for you.

**Pros:**

* Dependable video quality in 180p, to rival more expensive webcams
* Long cord
* Built-in hardware compression to maintain stream quality

**Cons:**

* Doesn’t have the add-ons of the C922
* Audio is occasionally muffled

#### 2. The Best Premium Webcam for Twitch Streaming: Logitech C922

The [Logitech C922](https://amzn.to/34KkM1F)is the gaming-focused successor to the C920\. It has all the features of the C920 with a bit extra. The C922 can stream **at 60 FPS in 720p**; and has a **noticeable upgrade in image quality in low-lighting**. This can be especially useful if you are streaming without a lighting set-up. The C922 also has a **background replacement feature** which you might have seen being used by some of your favorite Twitch streamers.

However, the background removal feature is software powered and the higher processor load can lead to lag.

**Pros:**

* Fantastic video quality with 60 FPS at 720p and 30 FPS at 1080
* Excellent low-light self-correction
* Background replacement feature designed for live streaming games

**Cons:**

* Background replacement can lead to performance issues
* Limited audio quality compared to external mics
* Cost

#### 3. The Best New Webcam for Twitch Livestreaming: Razer Kiyo

If you are new to Twitch live streaming you might not have an elaborate lighting setup like some of the more popular streamers. As a lot of streamers know, adding even minor lighting to your streams can make so much difference. That’s where the brand-new [Razer Kiyo](https://amzn.to/3gyCKqJ) comes in. The Kiyo has a **modern aesthetic**, with **twelve white LED lights in a ring formation around the lens**.

The lights are adjustable with 12 different brightness settings. Razer consulted Twitch streamers in developing this camera, so it’s one of the few on the market **designed specifically for you**.

The Kiyo is in the same price bracket as the C922, and like the C922 it gives you **60 FPS at 720p and 30 FPS at 1080p**. However, compared to the mics on the Logitech C920 and C922, the Kiyo has shown to underperform.

We have reviewed the Razer Kiyo webcam in details, you can check [Razer Kiyo webcam review](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

**Pros:**

* Built for Twitch streamers
* Forward-thinking LED lighting
* Excellent image quality at 720p and 1080p

**Cons:**

* Native mic audio quality is not as high as comparable cams
* Cost

#### 4. The Best Cheap Webcam for Twitch Livestreaming: Microsoft LifeCam Cinema

![Lifecam Cinema Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lifecam-cinema.jpg)

If you are looking for a more budget-friendly webcam, then the [Microsoft LifeCam Cinema](https://amzn.to/3LnmV4c) is for you. It has a **maximum resolution of 720p**, with **HD video up to 30 FPS**. It sits on a **360-degree swivel mount** and the **TrueColor Technology** automatically boosts the image quality of the broadcast.

Like the Kiyo, the LifeCam’s mic underperforms compared to some of the other webcams, sometimes allowing background noise through that other mics would cancel. While its video and audio quality are surpassed by other webcams, its low-price makes it a **good option for novice streamers**.

**Pros:**

* Cost
* A 360-degree swivel for multiple angles

**Cons:**

* The auto-focus feature can be slow to adjust
* Native mic audio quality is not as high as comparable cams

#### 5. The Best High-Quality Webcam for Twitch Livestreaming: Logitech 4K Pro

![Logitech 4K pro Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-4k-pro-webcam.jpg)

<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884002/19272" target="_top" id="1884002">

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

The [Logitech 4K Pro](https://amzn.to/3BdXhdm) is the **world’s first 4K webcam**. Logitech has upped its game with this webcam, allowing streamers to produce **professional-quality videos**. The 4K Pro is packed with additional features. Including **infrared facial recognition**, **5x digital zoom**, **90-degree field of vision,** and **RightLight with HDR** for recording in low-light environments.

Unfortunately, the webcam’s clip is a step down from those on the C920 and the C922, and it doesn't hold the camera tight against the display. Although, if you can put up with that then the 4K Pro takes the best shots you’ll find right now, if you have the software to support 4K.

**Pros:**

* Beautiful 4K images
* Works well in low-light
* Great sound quality
* 90-degree field of vision

**Cons:**

* The clip doesn’t hold tight against displays
* Cost

We have reviewed the Logitech 4K Pro Webcam in details, you can check the [Logitech 4K Pro webcam complete review](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The overriding sentiment seems to be if in doubt choose Logitech! The Logitech C920 remains a firm fan-favorite for Twitch streamers, but the C922 is an impressive upgrade. With some Twitch streamers now making upwards of $5000 a month, you might want to be investing in a serious piece of kit.

In that case, go for the Logitech 4K Pro. It might have an annoying clip but there is just nothing else like it on the market now. At the other end of the scale, the Microsoft LifeCam is always a good choice and the Razer Kiyo is one to keep your eyes on!
