### What is needed for video conferencing?

 If you want to have a flawless video conferencing experience, you need to take care of a few things. Firstly, a [high-resolution webcam](https://www.techradar.com/news/where-to-buy-a-webcam) is a must-have item for video conferencing. The minimum resolution for video conferencing is 1280x720 resolution (720p), a 720p camera, and go up to a 4K support as high as 3840x2160 resolution. Secondly, you need a minimum of 2 GB of RAM and a quad-core processor. Next comes the **Network Bandwidth** that depends on the resolution and frame rate you desire that is 1 Mbps for 15 fps at 720p resolution, while 30 fps at 4K will require closer to 4 Mbps with a strong WI-FI network.

 Apart from the system requirements, you will also need a [microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a video display screen, and video conferencing equipment, software, or even [video recording software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
