[Video conferencing services](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) have almost eliminated the need for conventional meetings, as a growing number of companies are using them to hire new talent, provide training for their employees or organize team meetings.

## The Ten Best Video Conferencing Software That Provide Screen Sharing Options

Even though each video conferencing software we included in this article can be used for free, some of the services offer only a limited set of options on their free versions. This means that the number of participants or the maximum duration of a group meeting can be restricted.

Purchasing a subscription plan is your only option if you want to be able to use all tools these video conferencing services have to offer. Here are the ten best video conferencing software products that provide screen sharing features.

### 1\. [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com/en-ie)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $12.00 per month

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web

There are only a handful of video conference services out there that offer more than GoToMeeting. You can use this app directly from your web-browser, on your Smartphone or Macs and PCs. The free version of GoToMeeting includes the screen sharing feature and it provides webcam support.

![ GoToMeeting Screen Sharing options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-screen-sharing.jpg)

Sharing a screen with GoToMeeting is a simple process that can be completed in just a few easy steps regardless of the device you’re using. However, if you opt for the free version of this video conferencing service you won’t be able to host meetings that have more than three participants. Furthermore, the maximum duration of a group meeting is limited to just forty minutes which makes the free version of GoToMeeting a good option just for individuals and small businesses. If you want to have access to unlimited cloud recording, automatic transcription or keyboard and mouse sharing options you will have to purchase the Business or Enterprise subscription model.

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, web

In case you are looking for a video conferencing service that allows you to host meetings that have up to a hundred participants for free, then Zoom is the right choice for you. Moreover, the platform doesn’t limit the number of meetings you can host, although hosting meetings that are longer than forty minutes is not possible on the free version of Zoom.

As a host of a Zoom meeting, you can enable one or more participants to [share screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) simultaneously. The service also allows the host to disable this option entirely or to choose which participants can have access to this option during a meeting.

![ Share Screen on Zoom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-screen-to-share-on-zoom.jpg)

Zoom cannot display more than 25 screens within the same window, which can limit your options if you are hosting a meeting with a large number of participants. You can[record all of your meetings](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to a local hard drive if you are using the Mac or PC version of Zoom, but you must upgrade to a paid version of Zoom if you want to store your recordings on the cloud.

### 3\. [Cisco Webex](https://www.webex.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $14.00 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android

Entrepreneurs who want to host meetings with up to a hundred participants for free should consider using Cisco Webex. In addition, you can use a number of devices such as the Cisco Webex Board, room or desk devices for your presentations and meetings.

![ Share Screen on Cisco Webex](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/webex-screen-sharing.jpg)

Screen sharing is just one among countless options you will have at your disposal if you opt for the free version of Cisco Webex since this video conferencing service enables you to choose between different view outlines, create personal rooms or share files without any limitations. What’s more, you can host an unlimited number of meetings that can last for as long as you want, because there are no restrictions regarding the maximum duration of a meeting. The screen sharing feature is available even on the Cisco Webex mobile app so that you can share your device’s screen even if you are attending a meeting from you phone.

### 4\. [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android

Skype is probably one of the oldest applications that provides video call services to its users for nearly two decades. Besides offering video chat and messaging tools, Skype also allows you to organize conference calls with up to fifty participants. All you need to do in order to create a conference call on Skype is to generate a call link with a single click and then share the invitations with the participants who can join the call via the unique link you send to them.

Each participant in a conference call can share their screen at any point in the meeting which makes the collaboration between different team members easier. You can record all your conference calls and Skype is going to store them for an entire month before deleting them. However, Skype offers fewer options than most video conferencing services, since you can’t schedule meetings in advance, create private rooms or adjust the meeting’s settings.

### 5\. [Apache OpenMeetings](https://openmeetings.apache.org/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, Linux, Ubuntu

This open-source software is equipped with a broad range of video conferencing tools that enable you to schedule meetings, send instant messages or even edit documents. The maximum number of participants in a meeting depends on the type of meeting you select since you can create conference rooms with up to 32 participants, webinars with up to a hundred attendees or interviews that can’t include more than two persons.

It is hardly surprising that Apache OpenMeetings allows its users to share screens during video calls because the software is stacked with features that can potentially make the collaboration between team members more productive. In addition, you can record all video conferences you organize with this software, although you can only store footage on your local hard drive. Apache OpenMeetings is far from easy to use, and you are going to need some coding experience in order to optimize the software in accordance with your needs.

### 6\. [Join.Me](https://www.join.me/)

**Price:** Free trial available, pricing plans start at $10 per month

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, iOS, Android

Even though hosting meetings on Join.Me used to be free, the company discontinued the free version of the software a little over a year ago. Currently, you can only host a meeting on Join.Me if you purchase a monthly subscription, but participants don’t have to pay a fee in order to attend a meeting.

In case you opt for the least expensive Lite subscription model you will be able to host meetings that have up to five participants, although the webcam streaming option is not going to be available. The screen and window sharing feature is available within all subscription models, which means that you can use this collaboration tool regardless of the pricing plan you choose. None of the subscription models offered by Join.Me limits the maximum number of meetings you can have in one month or their duration. However, if you want to get access to recording features or store your videos online you will have to opt for the Pro or Business subscription plan.

### 7\. [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

All you need to host a video call that has up to ten participants is a Google account and access to a web browser, and Google Hangouts is going to take care of the rest. Although Google Hangouts isn’t necessarily the first option that comes to mind when video conferencing platforms are mentioned, the app is still a reliable choice for anyone who wants to host a video meeting.

What’s more Google Hangouts is equipped with screen sharing features which makes it a perfect collaboration tool for small and medium-sized teams. The best part is that like most of Google’s apps, Google Hangouts is completely free. However, the app is not without limitations, so you shouldn’t expect to find any advanced video conferencing options offered by Zoom or GoToMeeting. Even so, Google Hangouts offers a quick solution if you want to host an online meeting without having to go through the software installation process.

### 8\. [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/products/teamviewer/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $33.00 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Android, iOS

Although TeamViewer isn’t a video conferencing software, it is one of the best options you’ll have if you want to access different devices remotely. It is commonly used by customer support teams to provide assistance to users who are experiencing difficulties with a software product, but you can also use it to transfer large files, print documents remotely or install applications on a Smartphone or a computer.

Furthermore, you can install [Blizz TeamViewer](https://www.blizz.com/en/) if you want to schedule meetings that have up to 300 participants, record your meetings or enable members of your team to share their screens during meetings. The platform enables you to set up a meeting with a single click, while it also offers the HD VoIP option that allows you to reach your clients and colleagues wherever they are. Even though TeamViewer and Blizz TeamViewer can be downloaded for free, you must purchase a subscription plan in order to use all of the features they have to offer.

### 9\. [FreeConference](https://www.freeconference.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $9.99 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS

Besides video conferencing tools, this software also offers free conference calls, you just have to pick a free dial-in number or even choose a dedicated dial-in number. Setting up a video conference is an intuitive process that won’t take more than a few moments of your time.

However, the free version of FreeConference doesn’t allow you to host meetings that have more than five participants. Each participant can share their screen easily regardless of the pricing plan you have, while they can also communicate via chat throughout the meeting. Conference calls that are not hosted over the Internet can have up to a hundred participants and you can have an unlimited number of calls if you are calling local numbers. Online whiteboard, document sharing or SMS entry are also the options you’re going to have at your disposal if you choose the free version of the FreeConference software. Keep in mind that audio and video recording options are not going to be available unless you purchase a conferencing plan.

The maximum number of participants is limited to 25, although you can host up to 300 participants if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.

Unlike other video conferencing services that provide HD video quality, Lifesize Video Conferencing offers support for 4K video meetings, although this option is only available within Plus and Enterprise pricing plans. Unsurprisingly, sharing a screen during a meeting is remarkably easy as you just have to click on the Present button and decide if you want to share the entire screen or just an application window. Recording a meeting is not possible with the free version of the software, while the scheduling options leave much to be desired regardless of the pricing model.

**Conclusion**

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

[Video conferencing services](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) have almost eliminated the need for conventional meetings, as a growing number of companies are using them to hire new talent, provide training for their employees or organize team meetings. In addition, most of these platforms grant you access to various collaboration tools that make the participants in a meeting more productive.

**Screen sharing** is undoubtedly one of the most useful collaboration tools video conferencing services can offer, as it allows the users to share a live feed of their computer screens with all other attendees of a web conference. This, in turn, enables the swift flow of information between all participants in a video conference and it gives them immediate insight into everything that is happening on a shared screen.

We’ve done some researches and find out some video conferencing services that offers screen sharing. In this article we are going to take you through the ten best options you can use free of charge.

## The Ten Best Video Conferencing Software That Provide Screen Sharing Options

Even though each video conferencing software we included in this article can be used for free, some of the services offer only a limited set of options on their free versions. This means that the number of participants or the maximum duration of a group meeting can be restricted.

Purchasing a subscription plan is your only option if you want to be able to use all tools these video conferencing services have to offer. Here are the ten best video conferencing software products that provide screen sharing features.

### 1\. [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com/en-ie)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $12.00 per month

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web

There are only a handful of video conference services out there that offer more than GoToMeeting. You can use this app directly from your web-browser, on your Smartphone or Macs and PCs. The free version of GoToMeeting includes the screen sharing feature and it provides webcam support.

![ GoToMeeting Screen Sharing options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-screen-sharing.jpg)

Sharing a screen with GoToMeeting is a simple process that can be completed in just a few easy steps regardless of the device you’re using. However, if you opt for the free version of this video conferencing service you won’t be able to host meetings that have more than three participants. Furthermore, the maximum duration of a group meeting is limited to just forty minutes which makes the free version of GoToMeeting a good option just for individuals and small businesses. If you want to have access to unlimited cloud recording, automatic transcription or keyboard and mouse sharing options you will have to purchase the Business or Enterprise subscription model.

### 2\. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $14.99 per month

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, web

In case you are looking for a video conferencing service that allows you to host meetings that have up to a hundred participants for free, then Zoom is the right choice for you. Moreover, the platform doesn’t limit the number of meetings you can host, although hosting meetings that are longer than forty minutes is not possible on the free version of Zoom.

As a host of a Zoom meeting, you can enable one or more participants to [share screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) simultaneously. The service also allows the host to disable this option entirely or to choose which participants can have access to this option during a meeting.

Zoom cannot display more than 25 screens within the same window, which can limit your options if you are hosting a meeting with a large number of participants. You can[record all of your meetings](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to a local hard drive if you are using the Mac or PC version of Zoom, but you must upgrade to a paid version of Zoom if you want to store your recordings on the cloud.

![ Share Screen on Cisco Webex](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/webex-screen-sharing.jpg)

Screen sharing is just one among countless options you will have at your disposal if you opt for the free version of Cisco Webex since this video conferencing service enables you to choose between different view outlines, create personal rooms or share files without any limitations. What’s more, you can host an unlimited number of meetings that can last for as long as you want, because there are no restrictions regarding the maximum duration of a meeting. The screen sharing feature is available even on the Cisco Webex mobile app so that you can share your device’s screen even if you are attending a meeting from you phone.

### 4\. [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android

Skype is probably one of the oldest applications that provides video call services to its users for nearly two decades. Besides offering video chat and messaging tools, Skype also allows you to organize conference calls with up to fifty participants. All you need to do in order to create a conference call on Skype is to generate a call link with a single click and then share the invitations with the participants who can join the call via the unique link you send to them.

Each participant in a conference call can share their screen at any point in the meeting which makes the collaboration between different team members easier. You can record all your conference calls and Skype is going to store them for an entire month before deleting them. However, Skype offers fewer options than most video conferencing services, since you can’t schedule meetings in advance, create private rooms or adjust the meeting’s settings.

### 5\. [Apache OpenMeetings](https://openmeetings.apache.org/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, Linux, Ubuntu

This open-source software is equipped with a broad range of video conferencing tools that enable you to schedule meetings, send instant messages or even edit documents. The maximum number of participants in a meeting depends on the type of meeting you select since you can create conference rooms with up to 32 participants, webinars with up to a hundred attendees or interviews that can’t include more than two persons.

It is hardly surprising that Apache OpenMeetings allows its users to share screens during video calls because the software is stacked with features that can potentially make the collaboration between team members more productive. In addition, you can record all video conferences you organize with this software, although you can only store footage on your local hard drive. Apache OpenMeetings is far from easy to use, and you are going to need some coding experience in order to optimize the software in accordance with your needs.

However, if you want to get access to recording features or store your videos online you will have to opt for the Pro or Business subscription plan.

### 7\. [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)

The platform enables you to set up a meeting with a single click, while it also offers the HD VoIP option that allows you to reach your clients and colleagues wherever they are. Even though TeamViewer and Blizz TeamViewer can be downloaded for free, you must purchase a subscription plan in order to use all of the features they have to offer.

### 9\. [FreeConference](https://www.freeconference.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $9.99 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS

Besides video conferencing tools, this software also offers free conference calls, you just have to pick a free dial-in number or even choose a dedicated dial-in number. Setting up a video conference is an intuitive process that won’t take more than a few moments of your time.

However, the free version of FreeConference doesn’t allow you to host meetings that have more than five participants. Each participant can share their screen easily regardless of the pricing plan you have, while they can also communicate via chat throughout the meeting. Conference calls that are not hosted over the Internet can have up to a hundred participants and you can have an unlimited number of calls if you are calling local numbers. Online whiteboard, document sharing or SMS entry are also the options you’re going to have at your disposal if you choose the free version of the FreeConference software. Keep in mind that audio and video recording options are not going to be available unless you purchase a conferencing plan.

### 10\. [Lifesize Video Conferencing](https://www.lifesize.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $16.95 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android

Lifesize Video Conferencing is a perfect option for you if you need to host a large number of meetings for free on a monthly level because it enables you to host an unlimited number of meetings every month. The maximum number of participants is limited to 25, although you can host up to 300 participants if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.

Unlike other video conferencing services that provide HD video quality, Lifesize Video Conferencing offers support for 4K video meetings, although this option is only available within Plus and Enterprise pricing plans. Unsurprisingly, sharing a screen during a meeting is remarkably easy as you just have to click on the Present button and decide if you want to share the entire screen or just an application window. Recording a meeting is not possible with the free version of the software, while the scheduling options leave much to be desired regardless of the pricing model.

**Conclusion**

A simple feature like screen sharing can make a world of difference for your team’s productivity, as it enables the participants in a meeting to present their ideas or collaborate on a document effortlessly. This feature is included in the free version of most video conferencing software products you can find on the market, which means that the participants of the meetings you host are going to be able to share their screens even if you don’t purchase a subscription plan. Which free video conferencing service that offers screen sharing features are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know?
