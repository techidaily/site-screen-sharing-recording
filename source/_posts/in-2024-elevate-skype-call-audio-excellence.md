Skype is used for a variety of purposes like keeping touch with family members, holding seminars, online classes, conducting workshops, explaining projects, etc. It is utilized both by working and non-working class in many ways and enables you to record a video call and play it whenever you wish, which is very helpful in cases of workshops, meetings, seminars, and whatnot.

But a small problem that often arises while recording a video call is the background noise which is a bit irritating and compromises the total clarity of the video. So here are some ways to **remove background noise** and improve the voice quality in Skype video calls.

* [**Part 1:** How to Avoid Background Noise Before Skype Video Calls](#part1)
* [**Part 2:** How to Remove Background Noise After a Recording Was Done](#part2)

## Part 1: How to Avoid Background Noise Before a Skype Video Call

* 1\. Turn on your desktop and tap the **Sound** icon at the right end of the Taskbar
