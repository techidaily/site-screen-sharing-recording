## Clandestine Call Collectors: A Stealthy Apps Review (Android/iOS)

In today’s world, you cannot prove anything to anyone unless you have concrete evidence.

The world has moved on from a secret voice recording device to a secret voice recording app. This is because we have our smartphones with us all the time. All you need is a voice recorder app to record any conversation without getting suspected.

However, a regular voice recorder app is not enough as any person around you could notice your phone screen and understand that you are recording. Instead, you need a secret voice recording app that can record in the background when the display is off. You can also record voice calls with such a voice recorder app without the other person getting any alert. We have compiled the list of best secret voice recorder apps for Android and iOS.
