The VFX method, known as "green screen", involves the layering or composite of two pictures or video streams. Editors often erase the shot's original backdrop to insert surreal or otherworldly ones. Simply said, you're creating the illusion of a single picture by superimposing one image or video stream on top of another.

Applications that may be used to modify the backdrop of a video are known as [green screen software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The video timeline may be simply edited and trimmed utilising this application. They provide you with the option of changing the backdrop color of the video clip. Many of these tools let you record video with virtual background without green screen.
