## Way 2\. Use Dacast

Dacast is an extremely popular platform for organizing live stream conference and meeting. Apart from live streaming, you can host your video on the platform as well as monetize your video to earn revenue. Most importantly, you can record your live stream video conference so that the audiences can re-watch them at any future instance. You can record video up to six hours at a time. Here are the steps to record your live stream video on Dacast.

Step 1: Create a live channel on Dacast and set the following settings so that recording works perfectly.

Step 2: Go to General section and turn on Live Stream Recording option. Once you turn it on, the recording will be automatic in the background once you start live streaming your video.

![decast live channel status](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/decast-live-channel-status.jpg)

The recording option stays activated for seven days. Thereafter, you have to activate it again from General section.

Step 3: The recording will stop automatically as soon as you stop your live stream. If you want to stop recording in between, you have to disable the recording option and save VOD file. You can find the recorded video under “Video on Demand” option.
