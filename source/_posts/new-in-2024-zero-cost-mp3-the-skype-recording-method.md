## **Part 2: How to record skype call via mp3 skype recorder?**

Though recordings are fully automatic on this tool however few steps are required to set up the recording to start on its own.

**Step 1**: Make sure the **ON** button is pressed and its green to start automatic recordings.

**Step 2**: Switch off the automatic recording button by selecting the **OFF** button if you are willing to record the calls manually. When the calls are ready to be recorded you can click on the **ON** button to reactivate the recording on the current call.

**Step 3**: As the process is automatic, whenever a call is detected mp3 skype recorder will start on its own and a small indication will be displayed when the recording is started. If you don’t need this alert then you need to buy the pro edition of mp3 skype recorder.

![start recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-record2.jpg)

**Step 4**: To check if the recorder is working fine, you can check the recording status on the bottom bar of the recorder window. You will see that the current mp3 size is changing consistently and that indicates that the recorder is getting sound that is being encoded into a file.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 5**: Once the call is done, the recording will stop or you can stop it by clicking on the **OFF** button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

The easiest way to access your skype call recordings is to click the icon with a large folder & music note image on it. You will see this icon on the main screen of mp3 skype recorder.

**Step 2: Recording path folder**

You can check the folder where the skype recordings are being saved by clicking the recording destination folder located on the recorder’s window.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 3: Change the recording path**

If you want to change the recording destination then click on the path and choose the folder where you want to save the recordings.
