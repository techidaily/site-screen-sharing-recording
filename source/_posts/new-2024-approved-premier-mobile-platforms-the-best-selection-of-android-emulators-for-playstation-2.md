**How can I use the PS2 Emulator for Android to play PS2 games?**

You'll need to have a PlayStation 2 BIOS in order to run certain emulators like DamonPS2 Pro, for example. On Google, you may also download this file and put it into the app's folder.

After you've done this, all you have to do is wait for the program to load so that you can begin playing.
