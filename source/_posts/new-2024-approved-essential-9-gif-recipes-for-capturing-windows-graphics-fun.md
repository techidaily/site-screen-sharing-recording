Screencasting on any version of Windows 7/8/10 is a simple task, and countless software products enable you to record your desktop activities.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

On the other hand, GIFs are small in size, and sending them via email or posting them on social media networks won't require you to wait for a long time until the file is uploaded to the web.

However, there aren't that many screen recorders for Windows OS that let you save screen recordings as GIF files, and for that reason, we've composed the list of best **GIF Recorders** for PCs. Let's have a look at some of the most powerful software products for creating animated GIFs on Windows.
