You can edit any part of the video and add transitions and video efforts to make it more eye-catching.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-comparing-streaming-software-obs-vs-shadowplay/"><u>2024 Approved  Comparing Streaming Software  OBS vs ShadowPlay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-top-choice-of-no-cost-video-calls-plus-shared-screens-selection/"><u>[New] Top Choice of No-Cost Video Calls + Shared Screens Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-art-of-gameye-immersive-video-recording-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Art of GamEye  Immersive Video Recording for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-mastering-hulu-capture-windows-mac-and-mobile-edition-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Hulu Capture  Windows, Mac & Mobile Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mint-magic-in-depth-analysis-and-instructions-for-ice-cream-cam/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Mint Magic  In-Depth Analysis & Instructions for Ice Cream Cam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-apeak-recording-examined-quality-and-features-decoded/"><u>2024 Approved  Apeak Recording Examined  Quality and Features Decoded</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/1715701103534-top-15-open-world-games-to-beat-the-climb/"><u>Top 15 Open World Games to Beat the Climb!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-durecorder-unveiling-its-core-capabilities-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] DuRecorder  Unveiling Its Core Capabilities for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-prime-10-affordable-webcam-streamers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Prime 10 Affordable Webcam Streamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/the-pros-playbook-expert-screen-capture-insights/"><u>The Pro's Playbook  Expert Screen Capture Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-dissecting-the-narrative-in-youtube-dialogues/"><u>[New] In 2024, Dissecting the Narrative in YouTube Dialogues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-your-guide-to-the-years-most-trending-background-music-downloads/"><u>New In 2024, Your Guide to the Years Most Trending Background Music Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/graphics-driver-revival-windows-edition/"><u>Graphics Driver Revival, Windows Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/navigating-the-online-marketplace-for-profitable-yt-content/"><u>Navigating the Online Marketplace for Profitable YT Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/how-to-optimize-video-production-with-adobe-presenter/"><u>How to Optimize Video Production with Adobe Presenter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-record-screen-with-vidmore-screen-recorder-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Record Screen with Vidmore Screen Recorder for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-initiating-seamless-zoom-gatherings/"><u>2024 Approved  Initiating Seamless Zoom Gatherings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-joining-friends-and-family-online-facebook-setup-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Joining Friends and Family Online (Facebook Setup Guide)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-revitalized-interview-questions-for-listener-involvement/"><u>In 2024, Revitalized Interview Questions for Listener Involvement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-downloading-samfw-frp-tool-30-for-infinix-gt-10-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Downloading SamFw FRP Tool 3.0 for Infinix GT 10 Pro</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This could only be done by jailbreaking the device or installing a third-party <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder</strong>.</p><p>Another alternative was to connect your device to a Mac and use QuickTime to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen. This can be also troublesome as you can not carry a Mac along with you if you need to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>But all this has changed with the outcome of iOS 11. Apple has added a built-in mobile screen recorder. With the <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad built-in screen recorder</strong>, you no longer need to jailbreak your device or install third-party screen recorders.</p><p>So, in this article, we will show you how to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen whether your iOS device is running the latest iOS 11 and later versions or not.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Use QuickTime to record iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]"></a>Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]</h2><p> The iOS 11 has come with a built-in mobile screen recording feature, so if you’re running the iOS 11 and later iOS versions, you can use the free recording tool of iPhone directly. This built-in app has provided a great alternative to the traditional methods to record screen videos without the use of third-party apps for iOS users. The built-in screen recorder has made the whole process very easy and simple. Follow the steps mentioned below if you want to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><ol><li>If you don’t have a screen recorder toggle on the Control Center, you need to enable the Screen Recording feature in the Settings on your iPhone&#x2F;iPad. First, tap the Settings app, and then tap Control Center &gt; Customize Controls. Find <strong>Screen Recording</strong> then tap the green “+” button beside it to add the Screen Recording feature to Control Center.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ios11.jpg"                      alt="ios 11"                ></p><ol><li>Open the Control Center by swiping up from the bottom of your iPhone&#x2F;iPad.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="ios screen recording"                ></p><ol><li>Tap the screen recording icon that looks like a solid circle enclosed in another circle. And you will see the start recording option and a microphone button. If you want to record the microphone audio, then tap it to turn on the microphone. Then, tap on Start Recording to start.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-screen-recording-start.jpg"                      alt="ios screen recording"                ></p><ol><li>The video recording will start after a 3-second delay and the recording button will turn red. A notification will also appear on the top indicating recording time.</li><li>After you are done recording, open the control center again and tap on the screen recorder button again. Alternatively, you can also tap on the red notification on the top of your screen and tap Stop at the prompt.</li></ol><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ios%20stop.JPG" alt="iPhone/iPad screen recorder"></p><ol><li>This will stop the screen recording and the recorded video will be saved in the Photos app.</li></ol><p>That’s the steps of how to record your iPhone screen in iOS 11 and later versions. If you want to edit the recorded video with some video editing apps, do not miss <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the top 10 best video editors for iPhone and iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>If your iOS device is running a previous version older than iOS 11, and you do not want to update, then you can record your iPhone screen with some best screen recorders for iOS, or record with QuickTime. In the following section, we will show you how to do it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-QuickTime"><a href="#Part-2-Use-QuickTime" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Use QuickTime"></a>Part 2: Use QuickTime</h2><p>People need to download and install a third-party iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder after jailbreaking the device and going through a complicated installation process. iOS is always risky to jailbreak your device as if you don’t do it carefully your device will get broken. It means your device will stop functioning and you will need to go to Apple care for getting it fixed. Jailbreaking also voids your warranty. So rather than going through these risks, people preferred using QuickTime to record their Phone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>With QuickTime media player you could record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s Screen. For recording your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen with the help of QuickTime, you would need Mac OS X. Below are the steps to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen on your Mac by using QuickTime.</p><p>1. Connect your iOS device (iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;iPod touch) to your Mac with a USB cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20logo.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><p>2. Launch QuickTime on your Mac available in the application folder.</p><p>3. Click on the File menu on the QuickTime menu bar and choose New Movie Recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20new%20moive.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><p>4. A video recording screen will open. Now slide the cursor over that window to make the record and volume button visible.</p><p>5. Click on the arrow next to the red record button to show the camera and microphone recording options. Choose your device from the list of devices and you will be able to see your device screen in the QuickTime window.</p><p>6. Click on the red record button when you want to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20iphone.jpg"                      alt="quicktime screen recorder"                ></p><p>7. To stop the recording of the screen of your iOS device, click on the Stop button at the video recorder window.</p><p>8. If you want to edit the video, you can do it in QuickTime (for basic editing). You can also save the recorded video first and then edit it later. You can directly save it as it is in QuickTime by going to File Menu and clicking on save option.</p><p>The recorded video will be saved in .mov file format which you can later export to view on certain devices. You can edit the video later in QuickTime, Wondershare Filmora, or others and share it online for tutorials or demonstration, and whatever you want to do with it. This method of recording the iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen is useful for devices running the iOS version lower than 11. This is a far safer method to record device screen video than jailbreaking. But with the addition of a mobile screen recorder app in iOS 11 and above, it seems a little bit clumsy by using QuickTime.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder is a very useful tool when you want to record tutorials, demonstrations, or report bugs. The demand for mobile screen recorders is rapidly increasing. Youngsters also love recording funny clips and videos to share the video on social media networks and other platforms. So which method offered above is better, no definite answer. All you need to consider is your own situation.

Organizing footage and knowing exactly where a certain shot is in that sea of unsorted material will increase your efficiency during the post-production period, thus enabling you to shorten the amount of time you have to spend editing it.</p><p>Markers can be used during the video editing and after the screen recording to make post-production, to help you mark the places in the footage where you’ve made a mistake, where the new take starts or to indicate a spot on the timeline where you would like to place a particular video clip. In this article, we are going to show you how to utilize markers during the screen capturing sessions or while you’re <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >editing videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Record desktop screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                > Secure Download</p><h2 id="Distinctions-Between-the-Two-Types-of-Markers"><a href="#Distinctions-Between-the-Two-Types-of-Markers" class="headerlink" title="Distinctions Between the Two Types of Markers"></a>Distinctions Between the Two Types of Markers</h2><p>Watching the footage you’ve captured over and over can be a tiresome process that consumes both time and energy, so in order to increase your efficiency during the process of capturing and editing videos, you can simply add markers both to the files you’re creating while recording or to your project’s timeline.</p><p>The <strong>media markers</strong> are the markers you can add directly to the video file you are creating with Filmora during the screen recording session. You won’t be able to see these markers until the video clip is imported into the software’s video editor and placed on the timeline.</p><p>You can use them to mark a place in the screen recording you’re not too happy with, or to highlight the part of the video clip that you intend on featuring in the final cut of the video you’ve created with Wondershare’s screen capturing and screen recording software. By doing so you’ll save time on going through all the material just to find a few seconds of footage that fit perfectly to your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-markers.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Scrn Markers"                ></p><p>The <strong>timeline markers</strong>, on the other hand, can only be added to a project once you’ve completed the recording session, during the post-production period. You can utilize them to highlight the parts of the video clip you want to remove from the final version of your video or to mark the spots on the timeline where you’d like to switch from one take to another.</p><p>This type of marker is immensely useful if you want to organize the timeline in your project better and to know exactly where every clip you want to use in your video is located at all times. Besides being a highly efficient tool for organizing vast amounts of footage, timeline markers can also help you denote the beats in the audio file and then sync the video clip perfectly to the beat of the tune you’re using as a soundtrack to your video.</p><h2 id="How-to-Add-Markers-During-Video-Editing-and-After-Screen-Recording-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Add-Markers-During-Video-Editing-and-After-Screen-Recording-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Markers During Video Editing and After Screen Recording in Filmora?"></a>How to Add Markers During Video Editing and After Screen Recording in Filmora?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><ul><li><a href="#filmora1">1.

This could only be done by jailbreaking the device or installing a third-party <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder</strong>.</p><p>Another alternative was to connect your device to a Mac and use QuickTime to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen. This can be also troublesome as you can not carry a Mac along with you if you need to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>But all this has changed with the outcome of iOS 11. Apple has added a built-in mobile screen recorder. With the <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad built-in screen recorder</strong>, you no longer need to jailbreak your device or install third-party screen recorders.</p><p>So, in this article, we will show you how to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen whether your iOS device is running the latest iOS 11 and later versions or not.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Use QuickTime to record iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]"></a>Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]</h2><p> The iOS 11 has come with a built-in mobile screen recording feature, so if you’re running the iOS 11 and later iOS versions, you can use the free recording tool of iPhone directly. This built-in app has provided a great alternative to the traditional methods to record screen videos without the use of third-party apps for iOS users. The built-in screen recorder has made the whole process very easy and simple. Follow the steps mentioned below if you want to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><ol><li>If you don’t have a screen recorder toggle on the Control Center, you need to enable the Screen Recording feature in the Settings on your iPhone&#x2F;iPad. First, tap the Settings app, and then tap Control Center &gt; Customize Controls. Find <strong>Screen Recording</strong> then tap the green “+” button beside it to add the Screen Recording feature to Control Center.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ios11.jpg"                      alt="ios 11"                ></p><ol><li>Open the Control Center by swiping up from the bottom of your iPhone&#x2F;iPad.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="ios screen recording"                ></p><ol><li>Tap the screen recording icon that looks like a solid circle enclosed in another circle. And you will see the start recording option and a microphone button. If you want to record the microphone audio, then tap it to turn on the microphone. Then, tap on Start Recording to start.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-screen-recording-start.jpg"                      alt="ios screen recording"                ></p><ol><li>The video recording will start after a 3-second delay and the recording button will turn red. A notification will also appear on the top indicating recording time.</li><li>After you are done recording, open the control center again and tap on the screen recorder button again. Alternatively, you can also tap on the red notification on the top of your screen and tap Stop at the prompt.</li></ol><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ios%20stop.JPG" alt="iPhone/iPad screen recorder"></p><ol><li>This will stop the screen recording and the recorded video will be saved in the Photos app.</li></ol><p>That’s the steps of how to record your iPhone screen in iOS 11 and later versions. If you want to edit the recorded video with some video editing apps, do not miss <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the top 10 best video editors for iPhone and iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>If your iOS device is running a previous version older than iOS 11, and you do not want to update, then you can record your iPhone screen with some best screen recorders for iOS, or record with QuickTime. In the following section, we will show you how to do it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-QuickTime"><a href="#Part-2-Use-QuickTime" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Use QuickTime"></a>Part 2: Use QuickTime</h2><p>People need to download and install a third-party iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder after jailbreaking the device and going through a complicated installation process. iOS is always risky to jailbreak your device as if you don’t do it carefully your device will get broken. It means your device will stop functioning and you will need to go to Apple care for getting it fixed. Jailbreaking also voids your warranty. So rather than going through these risks, people preferred using QuickTime to record their Phone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>With QuickTime media player you could record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s Screen. For recording your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen with the help of QuickTime, you would need Mac OS X. Below are the steps to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen on your Mac by using QuickTime.</p><p>1. Connect your iOS device (iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;iPod touch) to your Mac with a USB cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20logo.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><p>2. Launch QuickTime on your Mac available in the application folder.</p><p>3. Click on the File menu on the QuickTime menu bar and choose New Movie Recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20new%20moive.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><p>4. A video recording screen will open. Now slide the cursor over that window to make the record and volume button visible.</p><p>5. Click on the arrow next to the red record button to show the camera and microphone recording options. Choose your device from the list of devices and you will be able to see your device screen in the QuickTime window.</p><p>6. Click on the red record button when you want to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20iphone.jpg"                      alt="quicktime screen recorder"                ></p><p>7. To stop the recording of the screen of your iOS device, click on the Stop button at the video recorder window.</p><p>8. If you want to edit the video, you can do it in QuickTime (for basic editing). You can also save the recorded video first and then edit it later. You can directly save it as it is in QuickTime by going to File Menu and clicking on save option.</p><p>The recorded video will be saved in .mov file format which you can later export to view on certain devices. You can edit the video later in QuickTime, Wondershare Filmora, or others and share it online for tutorials or demonstration, and whatever you want to do with it. This method of recording the iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen is useful for devices running the iOS version lower than 11. This is a far safer method to record device screen video than jailbreaking. But with the addition of a mobile screen recorder app in iOS 11 and above, it seems a little bit clumsy by using QuickTime.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder is a very useful tool when you want to record tutorials, demonstrations, or report bugs. The demand for mobile screen recorders is rapidly increasing. Youngsters also love recording funny clips and videos to share the video on social media networks and other platforms. So which method offered above is better, no definite answer. All you need to consider is your own situation.

So, video-conferencing applications provide their users with a whiteboard to keep track of the discussion during a video call. <strong>Google Meet whiteboarding</strong> is one of the most effective tools for Google Meet users to make explanations easy. You can draw things on a <strong>whiteboard in Google Meet</strong> to make the video session more interactive and exciting.</p><p>If you are interested in using this fantastic tool, the following article will cover all the relevant details alongside an easy guide to use a whiteboard.

Google Meet integrates Jamboard, an online tool that enables you to brainstorm ideas during the virtual meet-up. The meeting host can easily activate Jamboard after starting a meeting. This makes <strong>Google Meet Whiteboarding</strong> easily accessible for all participants during the live session. In this way, students can collaborate with instructors or other students very clearly. Moreover, the whiteboard feature also allows them to answer questions and review notes. Let’s know how to use a whiteboard in Google Meet and how it works.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-a-Laptop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-a-Laptop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on a Laptop?"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on a Laptop?</strong></h2><p>The in-built whiteboard can be comfortably used in Google Meet on a laptop. You do not need any extension or third-party application to use a whiteboard. Moreover, you can create a new whiteboard or use the one you have already created. You can access the already saved whiteboard from Google Drive. If you want to excel in the art of creating a whiteboard on Google Meet, we have summarized the process in simple steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Join Google Meeting</strong></p><p>Open Google Meet and click <strong>new meeting</strong> to host a meeting.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You may also join the meeting using the invitation code or invite link.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Locate the whiteboard.</strong></p><p>Click on the <strong>three dots</strong> at the bottom of your screen and select <strong>the whiteboard</strong> at the top of the menu list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-whiteboard.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet whiteboard"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Create Whiteboard</strong></p><p>Click on the <strong>start a new whiteboard</strong> option**.**</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This will create a Jam that can be used to visualize ideas on a whiteboard. The link to the Jam can be copied and sent to all participants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-whiteboard.jpg"                      alt="create Google Meet whiteboard"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, you cannot access the <strong>Google Meet Whiteboarding</strong> feature when using Google Meet through its website on your smartphone. Thus, it is recommended to use third-party tools for using the whiteboard feature. In this case, you have to share your screen in the Google Meet session and then navigate to the third-party app having a built-in whiteboard. However, the participants will not be able to make any changes on the whiteboard, and they can only watch the visuals of your screen. Are you an iPhone user and want to use whiteboard apps? If yes, the following step-by-step guide will help you.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Microsoft whiteboard app</strong></p><p>Navigate the Microsoft app in the app store and click install.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Join Google meeting room and share screen</strong></p><p>Click three dots at the bottom and select share screen. Press the <strong>start sharing</strong> button to confirm the action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Use whiteboard in the Microsoft app</strong></p><p>Go to your home page and launch the Microsoft Whiteboard.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since you will be sharing the screen of your iPhone, participants will be able to see your whiteboard activity.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an Android Device"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an Android Device</strong></h2><p>Similar to iPhone, you cannot use the in-built Jamboard Google Meet tool on Android devices. Even if you try accessing Google Meet from the browser on your android phone, you are likely to be redirected to Google Meet, where there is no whiteboard option. So, the only way out is to download an external whiteboard app from Playstore and use its whiteboard. Your whiteboard activity will be visible to other participants in a Google Meet session when you share the screen. However, this option is only viable if you are the only one illustrating on the whiteboard and no other participants are required to perform any whiteboard activity. If this works for you, follow the step-by-step guide below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Whiteboard application</strong></p><p><strong>Find the Whiteboard app on the Google Playstore and click install</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Join Meeting and Share screen</strong></p><p><strong>Click new meeting and press dots at the bottom of your screen. Select the screen sharing option and confirm it.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 3: Access the Whiteboard app</strong></p><p><strong>Navigate to your home page and launch the whiteboard app. What you draw on the whiteboard will be visible to the meeting attendees.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-whiteboard-mobile.jpg"                      alt="create Google Meet whiteboard on mobile"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Save-and-Send-Jams-as-PDFs"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Save-and-Send-Jams-as-PDFs" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Save and Send Jams as PDFs?"></a><strong>Bonus: How to Save and Send Jams as PDFs?</strong></h2><p>Once you end up in a meeting, the Jamboard activity can be shared in a PDF file. This can help you recall the discussion during a class or seminar. Similarly, the saved Jams can also help you narrow down random ideas generated after brainstorming. Sounds Interesting? Learn to save and send Jams as PDF by following the easy steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open Jam</strong></p><p>Click on the Jam you want to download. Jamboard files will be visible at the right side of your Google Meet main window.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Open action list</strong></p><p>Click on the <strong>three dots</strong> at the top to access the <strong>more actions</strong> menu.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Download as PDF</strong></p><p>Select <strong>Download as PDF</strong> from the list of options. Locate the downloaded file in your download folder.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The downloaded PDF file can be shared as an attachment in the email. Likewise, you may use any other platform such as Whatsapp Web to send the saved Jams to your students, colleagues, and others.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-google-meet-whiteboard-as-pdf.jpg"                      alt="save Google Meet whiteboard as pdf"                ></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Google Meet allows its users to enjoy the vast collection of built-in tools. <strong>Google Meet whiteboarding</strong> is another helpful feature that makes brainstorming and visual illustration easy and efficient. The maximum utility of this feature is when you use it on your desktop or laptop. This gives all attendees whiteboard editing access. However, for mobile phone users, editing access is only for using an external whiteboard app. This article covered all dimensions, including setting up, using, and sharing whiteboards on Google Meet.
