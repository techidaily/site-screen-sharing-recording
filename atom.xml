    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Frame-Rate-Dilemma-30-Vs-60-FPS-in-Video-Production"><a href="#Frame-Rate-Dilemma-30-Vs-60-FPS-in-Video-Production" class="headerlink" title="Frame Rate Dilemma: 30 Vs. 60 FPS in Video Production"></a>Frame Rate Dilemma: 30 Vs. 60 FPS in Video Production</h2><p>You probably didn’t anticipate coming across so many technical terms when you first started recording videos. You only wanted to make quality content you know your audience will enjoy. Now you are hearing phrases like frame rate being tossed around, leaving you a bit intimidated.</p><p>After all, you want your videos to be the best they can ever be, don’t you? Plenty of thought and consideration goes into making a high-quality video for YouTube or any other social media platform where your audience will watch it. Therefore, educating yourself and applying the knowledge accordingly would be wise.</p><p>Keep reading this article to learn more about FPS in video recording and how to choose the best frame rate.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording"><a href="#Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Overview of FPS in Video Recording"></a>Overview of FPS in Video Recording</h2><p>A video works very similarly to a flipbook, which contains a series of still images. When you view these images at a certain speed, the animation unfolds, giving the illusion that the images are moving. Each image is known as a frame, and the frame rate is the speed at which the frames move. Frame rate is usually expressed as “frames per second,” or FPS in short.</p><p>If a video is set to play at 24fps, it means there are 24 frames in every second the video plays. Technology is very nifty and can trick your brain into the idea that animation flows smoothly. However, if the video were slowed down, you would notice that the motion is not as smooth as it seems. This smooth motion enables you to enjoy the video without hiccups or disruptions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-recording-fps.jpg"                      alt="fps in video recording"                ></p><p>In addition to influencing your audience’s viewing experience, the frame rate also affects how realistic you want your video to be. An FPS of 24 is ideal for movies because the motion is similar to how we see the world.</p><p>On the other hand, sporting events and video games require a higher frame rate to accommodate all the events happening simultaneously. The high frame rate also keeps the details crisp and ensures the motion is as smooth as possible. You wouldn’t want to watch a football match where the motion cuts every three minutes.</p><p>A lower FPS is ideal if you want to blur the video or use techniques like slow motion in the video. You could also opt for a lower FPS if you’re creating animated GIFs. Remember, you can’t make your GIF too large. Therefore, you would rather sacrifice detail and fluid motion and choose a low frame rate with a smaller size.</p><h2 id="What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?"></a>What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a rule set in stone that will guide you in choosing a frame rate. In fact, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding which frame rate will give your audience the best viewing experience. Research won’t yield the answers you are looking for since there are points to support just about any frame rate you google.</p><p>The simple fact is that different FPS will yield different results, meaning there is no perfect frame rate. The option you choose for your videos will depend on your unique needs and the type of content you want to create. However, there are a few factors you need to consider before you pick the best fps to record video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-recording-video-fps.jpg"                      alt="factors for choosing fps in video recording"                ></p><h4 id="Motion"><a href="#Motion" class="headerlink" title="Motion"></a>Motion</h4><p>If your video contains a lot of movement, it would be wise to stick to a higher frame rate to keep the motion crisp. We also urge you to capture the video at a higher frame rate for increased editing flexibility.</p><h4 id="Realism"><a href="#Realism" class="headerlink" title="Realism"></a>Realism</h4><p>Even though movies are fictitious, the concept should be tied to how we naturally see the world. For instance, when a person throws a ball, we see a bit of blur as the object moves in the air. Therefore, the frame rate you choose should mimic this motion blur and make your video more realistic.</p><h4 id="Delivery"><a href="#Delivery" class="headerlink" title="Delivery"></a>Delivery</h4><p>You can be lax about the frame rate if you want to deliver the video on the Internet because the viewers are a bit forgiving. However, we urge you to stick to 24fps if you project a movie in the theatre to give it a cinematic look. On the other hand, the best frame rate for recording video for TV would be between 24 to 30fps.</p><h3 id="File-size-and-export-time"><a href="#File-size-and-export-time" class="headerlink" title="File size and export time"></a>File size and export time</h3><p>Last but not least, it would be wise to consider the ideal file size for your video and how long it will take to export it. A higher frame rate means more still images are packed into one second of the video. The file size automatically increases, and you will notice that it takes longer to export your videos to platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.</p><h2 id="30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better"><a href="#30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better" class="headerlink" title="30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?"></a>30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?</h2><p>By now, you understand that 30fps means that 30 still images are packed into one second of the video. The same principle applies to 60fps. You will see 30 fps in soap operas, television, and live broadcasts. The shots in this frame rate are more detailed, even though they give the video an unrealistic feel because that isn’t how we naturally view the world.</p><p>On the other hand, 60fps is commonly used in fast-paced videos where you need enough frames to accommodate the action and enjoy the video. However, more filmmakers and directors are incorporating 60 fps in their videos to make the motion look smooth. Have you ever wondered how a slow-motion scene looks so crisp even when the camera zooms in on the actor? A 60-fps frame rate is the answer!</p><p>The debate still continues and people continue to compare 30 vs 60 fps video recording. As we mentioned earlier, there is no ideal fps recording. It all depends on what you want to do with your video.</p><p>For instance, if you want a slow-motion scene with little to no motion blur, then you are better off choosing 60 FPS. You could also choose a higher frame rate when shooting at concerts where a lot is happening at once.</p><p>However, smoothness is not always the best. You are better off sticking to realistic shots for movies or TV shows because that is what day-to-day life looks like. Therefore, 30 FPS is the best choice. An even lower frame rate would work if you want your movie to have a jittery feel or you want to insert a comedic feel into your content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/30-60-fps-video-recording.jpg"                      alt="30 vs 60 fps video recording"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304647">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304647%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304647/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording"><a href="#Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?"></a>Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?</h2><p>It wouldn’t be a great idea to jump into choosing a high frame rate for your video without understanding what it means or how it will affect the viewing experience.</p><p>Remember, a higher frame rate is not always the best fps for recording video. It might also do more harm than good and leave your video in shambles. You wouldn’t want to go back to the drawing board because you jumped on the bandwagon of choosing a high fps for the sake of it.</p><p>We urge you to do your homework and find out which frame rate works best for the content you want to create. A high fps recording also means your file will be bigger and take longer than usual to export.</p><p>A higher FPS isn’t the ideal choice if you are not willing to deal with a large file size. Another crucial factor to consider would be the viewing experience for your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135367/19272" target="_top" id="2135367">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135367" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135367/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS"><a href="#How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS" class="headerlink" title="How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?"></a>How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?</h2><p>Developers have been working tirelessly to create apps to help content creators and filmmakers like yourself record and edit their videos.

There is no performance lag even when you record at 4K resolution and it is a better alternative to iTop screen recorder.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-premium-podcast-partners-in-academia/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Premium Podcast Partners in Academia</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-pro-video-capture-a-comprehensive-fraps-test/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Pro Video Capture A Comprehensive Fraps Test</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-fundamental-guidelines-for-saving-lol-scores/"><u>[New] Fundamental Guidelines for Saving LOL Scores</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-essential-guide-to-cost-free-cam-screen-recording-apps/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Essential Guide to Cost-Free Cam Screen Recording Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-raising-livestock-a-guide-to-ginger-island-farm-for-2024/"><u>[New] Raising Livestock A Guide to Ginger Island Farm for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-ispring-screen-recorder-review-for-2024/"><u>[New] The iSpring Screen Recorder Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-conquer-business-the-top-12-tycoon-games-for-leaders-in-training/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Conquer Business The Top 12 Tycoon Games for Leaders-in-Training</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-stream-wars-unveiled-which-wins-obs-or-twitch/"><u>[Updated] Stream Wars Unveiled Which Wins, OBS or Twitch?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-visual-storytelling-on-macbook-webcam-setup/"><u>[Updated] Visual Storytelling on MacBook Webcam Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/mp4wav/"><u>「もっと楽に - MP4からWAVへのお手頃価格なオンライン変換サービス」</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-insightful-examination-of-wirecast-and-its-peers/"><u>2024 Approved Insightful Examination of WireCast & Its Peers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/alternative-to-obs-the-next-gen-stream-software-for-2024/"><u>Alternative to OBS The Next-Gen Stream Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/an-adagio-pastorale-movement-typically-features-tranquil-melodies-that-evoke-imagery-of-nature-or-idyllic-scenes/"><u>An Adagio Pastorale Movement Typically Features Tranquil Melodies that Evoke Imagery of Nature or Idyllic Scenes.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/connect-your-iphone-with-ease-overcoming-compatibility-challenges-on-windowsmac/"><u>Connect Your iPhone with Ease: Overcoming Compatibility Challenges on Windows/Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-find-ispoofer-pro-activation-key-on-vivo-v30-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Find iSpoofer Pro Activation Key On Vivo V30 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-dolby-advanced-audio-cannot-be-launched-in-windows-10/"><u>How to Fix 'Dolby Advanced Audio' Cannot Be Launched in Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-vivo-v30-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for Vivo V30 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-iphone-recovery-modes-a-comprehensive-tutorial/"><u>Mastering iPhone Recovery Modes: A Comprehensive Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/what-to-do-if-your-honor-x50iplus-auto-does-not-work-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>What To Do if Your Honor X50i+ Auto Does Not Work | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

So when I saw Cities: Skylines promise a more modern take on city-building, I picked it up. Years later, I can finally redeem myself and build a modern city from the ground up thanks to this sandbox city-builder game. At first, it was rough, but in my twenty hours of gameplay, I had a fun experience. Read on for the verdict to see how it stacked up with our list of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/games-console-reviews-4102640" >best city-building games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/WU7CbhbZ2iqnmzSxasaW_HLw7WQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cities-Skylines_05-6834bf27f720404a860b40ec9f311711.jpg"                      alt="Cities: Skylines"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Plot-A-sandbox-for-you-to-play-in"><a href="#Plot-A-sandbox-for-you-to-play-in" class="headerlink" title="Plot: A sandbox for you to play in"></a><strong>Plot: A sandbox for you to play in</strong></h2><p> If you wanted Cities:Skylines to have a plot, you are not in luck. Since it’s a sandbox city-building game, the base game’s sole goal is to allow you the freedom to build a city from scratch without any scenario restrictions. This removal of a plot is both refreshing and a curse. Two hours in, and I was having a blast building up roads and commercial areas; a couple hours later, and I could feel the itch to start a new map. There are no real scenarios, without real stakes, which later in the game presented a major problem for me.</p><p> Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order solved this issue by releasing a massive amount of expansions akin to the Sims franchise. Ranging from more simple content packs, like Modern Japan, or High-Tech Buildings, to expansions offering more features, like Sunset Harbor and Natural Disasters, scenarios become unlocked through their purchase.</p><p> Two hours in, and I was having a blast building up roads and commercial areas; a couple hours later, and I could feel the itch to start a new map.</p><p> The game’s menu will let you know which scenarios are associated with each expansion or content pack, so you’ll know what to pick up should you want a specific scenario. While I’m sure this will add hours of gameplay and offer a more challenging experience, I only tested out the base game for Cities:Skylines—though the option of natural disasters would make this pleasantville-like city-builder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/588X3UAailg5Hybxdvxqw8a_G-o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cities-Skylines_02-04c0ef53b3cf4183ae1388ed1216c2e6.jpg"                      alt="Cities: Skylines"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/c/5597632/1622438/14044" target="_top" id="1622438">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14044-1622438" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/i/5597632/1622438/14044"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Tough-learning-curve"><a href="#Gameplay-Tough-learning-curve" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay :Tough learning curve"></a><strong>Gameplay</strong> :<strong>Tough learning curve</strong></h2><p> At first, I couldn’t figure out Cities: Skylines. I wanted to love the game because it was a city-builder that was solely there to act as a sandbox. As I began to play it, though, I realized I had no idea how to play this game. Sure, you could build roads as well as residential and commercial areas, but ensuring the taxes associated with these properties turn into profit turned out to be really hard for me. A few tries later, and I decided that I needed to turn to YouTube to see how to start the game.</p><p> This rough beginning is something to which I fault Paradox. Every other city-builder I’ve played starts with some kind of introduction, a way to dip your toes into the game without destroying a city homes to thousands of digital people. Cities: Skylines throws you into the experience headfirst and expects you to succeed.</p><p> Cities: Skylines throws you into the experience headfirst and expects you to succeed.</p><p> Once I got past this bump in the road, though, a modern take on city-building led me to new heights. My citizens “tweeted” to me when I forgot to put in sewer lines. They sent out social media blasts praising new parks I put in, and they also made sure you knew if there were traffic problems. In fact, I never realized how much thought one needs to put into creating traffic lanes and streets until I became mayor of my cities. As I learned quickly, a lot of thought goes into it—and one lane roads are your new best friend.</p><p> That was part of the beauty of the 20 hours I spent playing Cities: Skylines, though. Modern times means that the idea of the modern city grows, too. The game starts out with two roads: one leading into town, and one leading out of it. Thanks to amazing local traffic simulations—a quality the game does and should boast of—you’ll have to build your population up to earn the right to build those highways.</p><p> The game starts out with two roads: one leading into town, and one leading out of it. Thanks to amazing local traffic simulations—a quality the game does and should boast of—you’ll have to build your population up to earn the right to build those highways.</p><p> Along with road options, other rewards come as your population grows: parks, commercial districting, industry building, loan options, even the concept of garbage disposal. I see why they did it. I would have been that weirdo who would have spent the original amount doled out to start the city on the Statue of Liberty just because I could. As weird as it seems initially, this rewards system makes sense.</p><p> As with the roads, this game is designed to be in a constant state of construction. You’re going to want to tear out roads and rebuild them. You’ll need to decide how much funding to invest into your local education or your garbage disposal (a lot to this last one). To build up a population, maybe you’ll have to tear out that adorable residential neighborhood in favor of high rise apartments that are designed to attract younger populations.</p><p> As much as I wanted to keep that children’s playground right next to the school, building a college campus beside the high school made more sense to build up my education numbers and create high wage jobs—even if the neighborhood released sad faces into the air over the loss. It’s what makes its reasonably fast gameplay interesting, and fun. And because it’s a sandbox, you’re the one who has to make these kinds of heavy decisions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/f8EjasEAuN7d0yNI_yXkZlPz8A4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cities-Skylines_03-4df9547f975749bbb7facb80717838b7.jpg"                      alt="Cities: Skylines"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1883998/19272" target="_top" id="1883998">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1883998" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1883998/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Bright-and-colorful"><a href="#Graphics-Bright-and-colorful" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Bright and colorful"></a><strong>Graphics: Bright and colorful</strong></h2><p> I went into Cities:Skylines, fully expecting a similar experience to<a class="link"   href="https://www.gog.com/game/simcity%5F3000" >SimCity 3000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on GOG). To my surprise, the graphics were fun and colorful. You can’t alter the buildings in any way, but Paradox and Colossal Order both made sure to have an array of color into the designs. In fact, to make the graphics any fancier I feel would have been a disservice to the game. It perfectly balances necessity and glamor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ScVT0Z65L44TgSD3IYaIaWCdXLA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cities-Skylines_04-83e9ebc98c9546dfa595e6baf45d23bf.jpg"                      alt="Cities: Skylines"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815679/21290" target="_top" id="1815679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815679/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Price-Not-bad"><a href="#Price-Not-bad" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad"></a><strong>Price: Not bad</strong></h2><p> Cities: Skylines will put you back around $30, which isn’t too bad. However, the issue I take with it being $30 is that it’s only for the base game. You won’t get the extra features of the expansions or content packs unless you can land a Steam sale. For a base game that doesn’t come with any scenarios other than the basic sandbox with a handful of maps, it’s a little frustrating. However, if you’re like me and can spend hours in sandbox games, then the price shouldn’t worry you too much.</p><p> For a base game that doesn’t come with any scenarios other than the basic sandbox with a handful of maps, it’s a little frustrating.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-city-builders"><a href="#Competition-Other-city-builders" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other city-builders"></a><strong>Competition: Other city-builders</strong></h2><p> Cities: Skylines is a regular city-building game. It doesn’t come with any wild sci-fi fantasy themes, like 2018’s science-fiction city-builder<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/464920/Surviving%5FMars/" >Surviving Mars <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam). In a similar vein to Surviving Mars, though, Cities: Skylines focuses on creating a city-state from scratch. Because it lacks the multitude of scenarios Surviving Mars has to offer, you’ll ultimately have to decide which you prefer: science fiction sized dust storms on a planet just now ready for colonization, or a plain green cityscape ready to be molded into a thriving metropolis. If you want a plain city-building game, then Cities: Skylines might be more geared toward your taste.</p><p> However, 2019’s<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/492720/Tropico%5F6/" >Tropico 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam) really gives Cities: Skylines a run for its money. In Cities: Skylines you’ll never have elections in your city, and your people will be kind even as they gripe about their lack of electricity in their coffee shop. Tropico 6 does not offer that luxury. In its multitude of scenarios, you’re going to anger a lot of people—so many, in fact, that you’ll have to watch out for rebellions and build up forces to fight the capitalists. I’m not saying that it’s easy—in fact, it’s quite difficult at times to manage the factions in Tropico 6.</p><p> That’s what makes Cities: Skylines a refreshing take on the city-builder. Because it’s a sandbox city-builder, I don’t have to worry about massive complications in city-building. There are fires and crime overlay risks, but at least I don’t have to lose sleep over whether the militarists will incite rebellion. Once again, if you want a plain city-builder where you can shape the entire course of your city, then Cities: Skylines is your best bet. If you want to “arrange accidents” for communists as well as hours-long scenarios, then pick up the more expensive Tropico 6.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An addictive city-building simulation, but you’ll need the DLC to take full advantage.</strong></p><p> For the base game, Cities:Skylines offers hours of creative, fast gameplay. If you want to be challenged more, then be prepared to shell out some extra cash for its large number of expansions. For a game whose base is solely a sandbox city-builder, it’s a great way to let your creativity shine while enjoying the amenities of the modern world for your residents.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Cities: Skylines</li><li>Product Brand  Colossal Order</li><li>Price  $29.99</li><li>Release Date  March 2015</li><li>Available Platforms  PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, XBox One, Nintendo Switch</li><li>Processor Minimum  Intel Core 2 Duo, 3.0GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 6400+, 3.2GHz</li><li>Memory Minimum  4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics  nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB (Does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards)</li><li>Game Expansions  Sunset Harbor, Campus, Industries, Parklife, Green Cities, Mass Transit, Natural Disasters, Snowfall, After Dark</li><li>Game Content Creator Packs  Modern Japan, Modern City Creator, University City, European Suburbia, High-Tech Buildings, Art Deco</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-finding-gratuitous-software-for-streaming-online-seminars-for-2024/"><u>[New] Finding Gratuitous Software for Streaming Online Seminars for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-remote-recording-mastery-a-comprehensive-approach/"><u>[New] Remote Recording Mastery A Comprehensive Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-top-tips-for-capturing-clear-facetime-dialogues-on-screen/"><u>[New] Top Tips for Capturing Clear FaceTime Dialogues on Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-combat-guide-to-top-fps-games/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Ultimate Combat Guide to Top FPS Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-delving-into-popular-discussion-threads-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Delving Into Popular Discussion Threads on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-strategies-for-sourcing-video-content-with-google-trends/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Strategies for Sourcing Video Content with Google Trends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/canoscan-lide-220-update-and-download-guide-for-optimal-scanning-performance/"><u>CanoScan LiDE 220 Update & Download Guide for Optimal Scanning Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/guide-switching-to-another-internet-browser-on-samsung-smarttvs/"><u>Guide: Switching to Another Internet Browser on Samsung SmartTVs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-practices-in-selecting-screen-recording-tools-for-windows-10/"><u>In 2024, Best Practices in Selecting Screen Recording Tools for Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-dose-life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-my-location-on-vivo-s18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Dose Life360 Notify Me When Someone Checks My Location On Vivo S18? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-android-video-editing-made-easy-top-10-free-and-paid-apps-for-2024/"><u>Updated Android Video Editing Made Easy Top 10 Free and Paid Apps for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You can also <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record Zoom meeting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if necessary.

Easy joining, too.</li><li>Cross-device compatibility lets you use it on your desktop, phone, or tablet – anywhere you like.</li><li>You can record or annotate your meetings. There is even an option to transcribe your speech, which you can later search back.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Can reach 100% of your phone performance while you use it.</li><li>If you have an old Android, then just run it on your laptop.</li></ul><h3 id="3-ezTalks-Video-Meetings"><a href="#3-ezTalks-Video-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="3. ezTalks Video Meetings"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eztalks-video-meetings/id1109287539" >ezTalks Video Meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eztalks-app.JPG"                      alt="ezTalks Video Meetings"                ></p><p>Supported Platform: Both Android and iOS, as well as browser, Mac, and Windows.</p><p>Third on our list is ezTalks Video Meetings. Again, high compatibility across devices earns it a right place on the list of the best conferencing apps. In terms of file sharing and screen sharing, ezTalks goes above and beyond the call of duty to bring you a seamless video conferencing service.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Gallery sharing, screen sharing, file sharing, and whiteboard facility.</li><li>No install can answer on either your phone or your browser, easy to join.</li><li>They are ergonomically designed to work with a patchy phone signal and not charge you extra for location.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>It’s not as well known as it should be.</li><li>Again, it is high on storage.

They have been doing their best to provide the masses with a virtual presence for years now. Cisco meetings have all the usual audio and visual features – but they specialize in providing a secure platform from which to conduct business. This stable platform is what makes them the best video conferencing app for business, in our eyes.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>It is a very secure system, which incorporates both audio and visual meetings of high quality.</li><li>Whiteboard and screen sharing capabilities.</li><li>It works from most high-tech cars. Toyota SDL car support comes as standard.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>There are compatibility flaws between whiteboard use and iOS in some cases.</li><li>Screen widget for Webex is only available for Android users.</li></ul><h3 id="5-Skype-for-Business"><a href="#5-Skype-for-Business" class="headerlink" title="5.

Skype for Business allows you to keep in touch with remote workers with a few short clicks. One of the best features of Skype is that they have been around for a long time. They have video calling down to a fine art. Second best? It is a unified communications platform that integrates with just about everything you will ever need. You can also <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share screen on Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with others.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Maximum compatibility – laptop, tablet, iPhone, Android – Skype for Business works with everything.</li><li>It can be used with Outlook and fully integrates everything Microsoft.</li><li>Very easy to learn user interface with options for training and various helpful features. Things like translation allows it to be the best video conferencing app for business – or at least up in the top three.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Audio and Video tends to stutter and glitch.</li><li>Uses all your phone processing power to keep it going.</li></ul><h3 id="6-GoToMeeting"><a href="#6-GoToMeeting" class="headerlink" title="6.

You could, feasibly, use this service to make a pitch or presentation. It’s highly scalable, too, so it can be used across large or small businesses.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Aside from calls – you can have one-on-one while you are in a big meeting.

OBS Studio is a superb broadcasting application that you may employ to record your games and share them in a straightforward, quick, and stream approach. One of the main issues when trying to shoot videos directly on your Android smartphone is that it generates substantial delay especially when you try to capture in real-time. OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software) is an application that allows you to record your video games and broadcast yourself over the Internet using sites such as the popular Twitch TV. You don’t have a dedicated webcam or costly streaming camera? Whatever your purpose may be, you simply wish to employ your Android mobile phones or tablet computer’s built-in camera using Open Broadcaster Software</p><p>The fundamental answer is No. Your approach should also feature some high-quality live streaming material, such as live event coverage, business announcements, and conferences. Most streamers use OBS as their choice of streaming software. They find the software convenient and budget-friendly since it is free. To set up Open Broadcaster Software so you may broadcast your games over the Internet, you simply have to get the stream key from your Twitch account, which you can easily achieve from your dashboard. But the point is, is it the finest app for live streaming? Since live streaming is creating more noise today than ever, a lot of us are looking for a trustworthy option for OBS to enhance the beauty of their video in terms of usefulness. You need to download an app that mirrors your phone’s screen to your PC, and then you can window capture the PC component of that program using OBS. There may be an app from the phone manufacturer, and a free open-source screen capture program for Android phones.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record computer screen and webcam</p><p>Capture system and microphone audio</p><p>Customize the target recording area</p><p>Edit videos with thousands of effects and tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Top-5-OBS-Studio-Alternatives-on-Android"><a href="#Top-5-OBS-Studio-Alternatives-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 OBS Studio Alternatives on Android"></a>Top 5 OBS Studio Alternatives on Android</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134223/18498" target="_top" id="2134223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134223/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-VidGrid"><a href="#1-VidGrid" class="headerlink" title="1.

Record Hangout Sessions on Phone"></a>Part 3. Record Hangout Sessions on Phone</h2><p>If you are using Google Hangouts from your phone and you want to record hangouts call and meeting sessions, we have different methods for iPhone and Android.</p><p><strong>For iPhone:</strong></p><p>If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you do not have to install any external app. This is because iOS 11 comes with an inbuilt screen recording feature. You can get access to this screen recorder from Control Center. If it is not readily available, you have to activate the feature and start recording the screen which is Hangouts calls and meetings here. Here are the steps you have to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open Settings app and go to on Control Centre.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and find Screen Recording option and turn it on.</p><p>Step 3: Open Google Hangouts app and start video call or meeting that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: Open Control Centre on your iPhone by swiping down or up as applicable.</p><p>Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you can start your Hangouts call or meeting.</p><p><strong>For Android:</strong></p><p>Android OS does not include any inbuilt screen recording option. Therefore, you have to install an external screen recording app for recording hangouts sessions. We recommend you install Mobizen screen recorder app on your Android smartphone so that you can record your Hangouts sessions as well as anything on your screen. It is a completely free app and there is no watermark issue.
