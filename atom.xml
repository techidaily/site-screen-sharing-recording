Working with <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong> in both scenarios is discussed below in detail:</p><h3 id="Part-1-Zoom-Audio-Settings-When-Before-Meeting"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-Audio-Settings-When-Before-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Zoom Audio Settings When Before Meeting"></a>Part 1: Zoom Audio Settings When Before Meeting</h3><p>If you are not already in a Zoom meeting and want to configure sound settings to get the best audio experience, you can follow the process given below:</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> A Windows 10 computer is used here to set up and configure audio settings in Zoom.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Access-Zoom-Audio-Settings-Box"><a href="#Step-1-Access-Zoom-Audio-Settings-Box" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Access Zoom Audio Settings Box"></a>Step 1: Access Zoom Audio Settings Box</h4><p>Launch Zoom, click the <strong>Settings</strong> (<strong>Gear</strong>) icon from the top-right corner and go to the <strong>Audio</strong> category from the navigation bar in the left of the <strong>Settings</strong> box that opens up next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-setting.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Settings icon"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Select-and-Test-Output-Device"><a href="#Step-2-Select-and-Test-Output-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Select and Test Output Device"></a>Step 2: Select and Test Output Device</h4><p>Use the <strong>Speaker</strong> drop-down list to pick your preferred output device (e.g., speakers, headphone, etc.), and click <strong>Test Speaker</strong> to listen to the sound that Zoom plays. Use the <strong>Volume</strong> slider to adjust the output volume at a suitable level.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-settings-audio.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Settings - Audio"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Select-and-Test-Microphone"><a href="#Step-3-Select-and-Test-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Select and Test Microphone"></a>Step 3: Select and Test Microphone</h4><p>Use the <strong>Microphone</strong> drop-down list to select an audio input source (typically a microphone), and click <strong>Test Mic</strong> to check if it is working fine. Use the <strong>Volume</strong> slider to adjust the input sound level manually. Alternatively, you can keep the <strong>Automatically adjust volume</strong> box checked to let Zoom automatically manage the input volume level as per the surrounding environment.</p><h3 id="Part-2-Zoom-Audio-Settings-During-an-Ongoing-Meeting"><a href="#Part-2-Zoom-Audio-Settings-During-an-Ongoing-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Zoom Audio Settings During an Ongoing Meeting"></a>Part 2: Zoom Audio Settings During an Ongoing Meeting</h3><p>As you initiate or join a Zoom meeting, the app pops up a box asking you to join the meeting with computer audio or test if the speaker and microphone are working before joining. On this box, you can also check the <strong>Automatically join audio by computer when joining a meeting</strong> box at the bottom to automatically use the computer’s sound device for audio output and input every time you host or participate in a meeting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-join.jpg"                      alt="Join Zoom Meeting"                ></p><p>Once you are in a conference, there are a couple of things you can do to manage the audio. The process of doing so is explained below in detail:</p><h4 id="Tip-1-Mute-Audio"><a href="#Tip-1-Mute-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Mute Audio"></a>Tip 1: Mute Audio</h4><p>During an ongoing meeting, click the <strong>Microphone</strong> icon present at the bottom-left corner of the main window to disable it. Click the icon again to re-enable the mic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-mute-audio.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Zoom Meeting Audio"                ></p><h4 id="Tip-2-Choose-Output-Device"><a href="#Tip-2-Choose-Output-Device" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Choose Output Device"></a>Tip 2: Choose Output Device</h4><p>Click the small up arrow next to the <strong>Microphone</strong> icon, and click to select your preferred output device (speakers, headsets, etc.) from the <strong>Select a Speaker</strong> section of the menu that appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-audio-speaker-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Zoom Meeting Audio Speaker Setting"                ></p><h4 id="Tip-3-Choose-Input-Device"><a href="#Tip-3-Choose-Input-Device" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Choose Input Device"></a>Tip 3: Choose Input Device</h4><p>While on the menu as explained in <strong>Tip 2</strong>, select an input device from the <strong>Select a Microphone</strong> section.</p><h3 id="Zoom-Audio-Poor-Quality-Troubleshooting"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Poor-Quality-Troubleshooting" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Poor Quality Troubleshooting"></a>Zoom Audio Poor Quality Troubleshooting</h3><p>While you are in a Zoom meeting, you might experience some issues related to the audio. These might be due to unmanaged positioning of the hardware devices, improper configurations of the <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong>, or both. Some of the most common Zoom audio problems and their possible solutions are discussed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-audio-advanced-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Settings Advanced Audio Settings"                ></p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It"><a href="#What-Is-It" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Audio feedback loop is when your voice keeps repeating itself for an indefinite number of times and never stops whatsoever.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >6 Top Voice Changer for Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h5 id="How-It-Happens"><a href="#How-It-Happens" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>When you are using external speakers and microphone, and both are placed nearby, any sound that comes out of the speaker is received by the microphone. If Zoom is configured to accept sounds from system audio, the mic sends the signals back to the speakers that again send the audio output to the mic. Since this iteration never ends, you continuously hear an audio feedback loop.</p><h5 id="How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?"></a>How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>In order to eliminate this issue, make sure to place both microphone and speakers at a safe distance from each other. This would prevent the microphone from receiving any output from the speakers, and the chain of audio feedback loop would never take place.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-1"><a href="#What-Is-It-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Background noise is the distortion or humming that you hear during an audio call on zoom.</p><h5 id="Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?"></a>Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>If you have a highly sensitive microphone that is mostly used by professionals or in recording studios, the chances are that it will catch a lot of background noise during a Zoom meeting.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?</h5><p>This issue can be resolved by either hosting or joining a meeting in a closed, soundproof room, or using a less sensitive mic. It would be best if you use a normal headset that is easily available in any local electronic shop. You can also try enabling the <strong>Automatically adjust volume</strong> option from the <strong>Microphone</strong> section of the <strong>Audio</strong> category of the <strong>Settings</strong> box as explained earlier in <strong>Step 3</strong> of the <strong>Zoom Audio Settings When Not in Meeting</strong> section.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-2"><a href="#What-Is-It-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p><strong>Zoom audio echo</strong> is when you hear an echo sound during an ongoing Zoom meeting with audio enabled.</p><h5 id="How-It-Happens-1"><a href="#How-It-Happens-1" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>Echo happens when you are on a laptop and are using onboard speakers and microphone, and that too with the speaker or mic volume set to maximum.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?</h5><p>As mentioned earlier, it is always advisable to use a headset to avoid any such unwanted echo or audio feedback loop issues. In case you don’t have access to a headset, try configuring the microphone settings to automatically adjust the volume, and not putting the speaker volume to the max.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Configuring <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong> before hosting or joining a meeting is always a wise approach to avoid any audio inconsistencies during an ongoing conference. However, if you are already in one, you can use the methods given above to configure the microphone settings to get the audio right. You are also encouraged to use an average quality headset during a Zoom meeting to avoid any <strong>Zoom audio echo</strong>, feedback loop, or background noises.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Improve Video Quality in Zoom Meetings? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/essential-insights-for-capturing-online-meeting-transcripts-for-2024/"><u>Essential Insights for Capturing Online Meeting Transcripts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-dissecting-the-capabilities-of-free2x-recording-software/"><u>2024 Approved  Dissecting the Capabilities of Free2X Recording Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-amd-graphics-relic-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] AMD Graphics Relic for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-video-quality-debate-the-pros-of-30-vs-60-fps/"><u>[Updated] Video Quality Debate  The Pros of 30 Vs. 60 Fps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-eight-outstanding-choices-for-private-video-communication-for-2024/"><u>[New] Eight Outstanding Choices for Private Video Communication for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-analysis-top-5-high-end-recording-apps/"><u>2024 Approved  Expert Analysis  Top 5 High-End Recording Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-macs-screenflow-insights-complete-coverage/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mac's ScreenFlow Insights - Complete Coverage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-tunefabs-cutting-edge-approach-to-live-streaming/"><u>In 2024, Tunefab's Cutting-Edge Approach to Live Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-come-up-with-the-best-pokemon-team-on-oppo-reno-11-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Oppo Reno 11 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/game-on-smartphones-android-vs-iphone-tetris-face-offs/"><u>Game On Smartphones: Android vs iPhone Tetris Face-Offs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-vivo-y27s-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Vivo Y27s to Other Android Devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-spreading-twitter-vid-facebook-integration-methods/"><u>[Updated] Spreading Twitter Vid  Facebook Integration Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-capturing-the-extremes-adobes-hdr-creation-in-lightroom/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Capturing the Extremes  Adobe's HDR Creation in Lightroom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-everything-you-need-to-know-about-unlocked-apple-iphone-xs-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Everything You Need To Know About Unlocked Apple iPhone XS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/selecting-the-best-free-melodies-for-your-youtube-video-for-2024/"><u>Selecting the Best Free Melodies for Your YouTube Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-the-art-and-science-behind-effective-youtube-shorts-templates/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Art & Science Behind Effective YouTube Shorts Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-presenter-8/"><u>2024 Approved  Unveiling the Strengths and Weaknesses of Presenter 8</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

OBS Studio is a superb broadcasting application that you may employ to record your games and share them in a straightforward, quick, and stream approach. One of the main issues when trying to shoot videos directly on your Android smartphone is that it generates substantial delay especially when you try to capture in real-time. OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software) is an application that allows you to record your video games and broadcast yourself over the Internet using sites such as the popular Twitch TV. You don’t have a dedicated webcam or costly streaming camera? Whatever your purpose may be, you simply wish to employ your Android mobile phones or tablet computer’s built-in camera using Open Broadcaster Software</p><p>The fundamental answer is No. Your approach should also feature some high-quality live streaming material, such as live event coverage, business announcements, and conferences. Most streamers use OBS as their choice of streaming software. They find the software convenient and budget-friendly since it is free. To set up Open Broadcaster Software so you may broadcast your games over the Internet, you simply have to get the stream key from your Twitch account, which you can easily achieve from your dashboard. But the point is, is it the finest app for live streaming? Since live streaming is creating more noise today than ever, a lot of us are looking for a trustworthy option for OBS to enhance the beauty of their video in terms of usefulness. You need to download an app that mirrors your phone’s screen to your PC, and then you can window capture the PC component of that program using OBS. There may be an app from the phone manufacturer, and a free open-source screen capture program for Android phones.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a>Filmora Screen Recorder</h5><p>Record computer screen and webcam</p><p>Capture system and microphone audio</p><p>Customize the target recording area</p><p>Edit videos with thousands of effects and tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Top-5-OBS-Studio-Alternatives-on-Android"><a href="#Top-5-OBS-Studio-Alternatives-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 OBS Studio Alternatives on Android"></a>Top 5 OBS Studio Alternatives on Android</h2><h2 id="1-VidGrid"><a href="#1-VidGrid" class="headerlink" title="1.

VidGrid’s replay feature comes in helpful by permitting viewers to review a live broadcast after it has been completed. Allowing viewers to go back and review your stuff assures they won’t miss out on your next broadcast.</p><p>Live streamers may offer virtual gifts to your followers using real money on top of the standard comments section. There’s also an easy search option to help customers identify the most popular and trending broadcasts, allowing broadcasters to extend their reach. While you’re broadcasting, you may adjust the broadcast quality to be low, medium, or high depending on your internet connection or bandwidth.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-VidGrid"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-VidGrid" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use VidGrid"></a>Steps to Use VidGrid</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1.</strong> Login using your email address and password.

Unlike other media players, QuickTime Player is not just for playing audio and video files. The application can record the screen on Mac and save the recordings on the hard drive. Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they <strong>cannot stop QuickTime screen recording</strong> following the standard procedure.</p><p>When the application fails to stop recording, it fails to save the recording as well. Therefore, QuickTime Player keeps recording the screen, and this slows down the Mac as it keeps occupying the system resources.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="From-Download-to-Implementation-Installing-OBS-on-a-MacPC"><a href="#From-Download-to-Implementation-Installing-OBS-on-a-MacPC" class="headerlink" title="From Download to Implementation: Installing OBS on a MacPC"></a>From Download to Implementation: Installing OBS on a MacPC</h2><p>OBS Studio has evolved into one of the most powerful audio recording software on the market today. Using OBS game capture, you may record screen games for YouTube videos or share snippets of gameplay with your friends for free. With this article, we’ll cover how to record in OBS and how much storage space you’ll need for your recordings. With OBS, it’s easy to keep track of high scores, great in-game performances, and even tips on how to play like a pro quickly and effectively. Since gamers may use several third-party screen-recording techniques when recording their games, learning how to record gameplay using OBS is an ideal solution. An open-source tool called OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) will be utilized in this lesson.</p><p>It is widely utilized by both large and small broadcasters throughout the world because of its reliability as a streaming solution. Despite this, it’s an effective tool for capturing images. OBS Studio enables you to record video directly to your device instead of broadcasting your screen. The days of framed screenshots and complex settings are over. Video game streamers and teachers with a lot of video presentations are likely to be acquainted with the OBS Studio. However, due to the complex user interface, it’s a little tough for beginners to utilize. The good news is that there are a variety of OBS options to pick from. When it comes to performance, it’s on par with other, more costly options. For the most part, the program allows for live streaming to several sites, such as Facebook Live and Hitbox.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install OBS on Mac"></a>1. Download and Install OBS on Mac</h2><p>OBS is an open-source screen recorder and live streamer that is free to use. It’s now available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It’s a popular choice among more seasoned customers because of the large variety of options available in the product.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to the OBS Website</strong></p><p>Go to the OBS download page using your choice browser and save the installation file to your computer’s hard drive.<br>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/download" >OBS Website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 2: Get the Most Recent Version of the Software</strong></p><p>You may get the most recent version of OBS for Mac by clicking the button on the OBS website.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Download and Install the Software for Mac</strong></p><p>Open the package after downloading it. Drag the OBS icon to the Applications folder when the installer has been opened.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-and-install.jpg"                      alt="download video from funimate"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Get Started!</strong></p><p>Open OBS for the first time by going to the Applications folder and double-clicking on it. Selected ‘Continue’ will bring up a Welcome Screen for the Installer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-started.jpg"                      alt="get-started"                ></p><h2 id="2-Best-OBS-Settings-for-Mac"><a href="#2-Best-OBS-Settings-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="2. Best OBS Settings for Mac"></a>2. Best OBS Settings for Mac</h2><p>OBS Studio is a complex software that comes with pre-installed screencasting capabilities. Free software often lacks the breadth of features required for flawless broadcasting, but not with OSB Studio. Even though the program is free, it features all of the crucial components that characterize online broadcasting. Many additional parts and modules will be given by the software now and then. That suggests it’s really necessary to dabble and refresh with it. Else, you can experience a few hassles in using OBS correctly.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch and Create Output Recorder Setup</strong></p><p>Add on the Plus symbol and create the project. If you want to activate audio monitoring in OBS Studio: Right-click in the Output box, Open the Output mode or you can also go for Advanced Audio Properties:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-recorder-setup.jpg"                      alt="output recorder setup"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Customize Record Only Feature</strong></p><p>In OBS for Mac, this setting will deliver the sound of the source to the Desktop as it were. Work area sound should be enabled for the sound to be captured. As soon as you activate this option, navigate towards the recording interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record.jpg"                      alt="customize record"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Set the Screen and Output Mode</strong></p><p>In OBS Studio for Mac, this setting will broadcast the sound of the source to the stream and Desktop sound separately. This takes into mind individual sound control. To do so, go to the bottom right corner of your screen and pick “settings.” Then, under “recording path,” select the “output” option to specify the spot on your computer where you desire to keep the recordings. Right after that, press the Record button to start recording your Game Audio in parallel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-mode.jpg"                      alt="output mode"                ></p><h2 id="3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Record Screen with OBS on Mac"></a>3. How to Record Screen with OBS on Mac</h2><p>OBS Studio is open-source, free software that is worth a try for all users. This strategy may be used to solve the problem if you have two graphics cards, one of which is NVIDIA. The OBS black screen is most likely caused by OBS and the game you desire to record running on different graphics cards in this situation. The image of the game can’t be acquired as they’re on separate adapters, and it’s not available on the device OBS is utilizing.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install and Launch OBS</strong></p><p>To purchase OBS Studio, go to the OBS Project’s official website and join up for their download portal. OBS is available for download and installation. After that, determine whether you want to use Windows, macOS, or Linux. Click the “Windows” download option on the left to acquire OBS for Windows. After clicking it, the download for OBS Studio will begin and the user will be able to locate it on their computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-and-launch.jpg"                      alt="install and launch"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Scenes for Recording</strong></p><p>OBS Studio will be available on their PC when the installation is complete, and players may use it to record their Valorous games. The software, on the other hand, does not come pre-configured for recording and must be set up manually. Scenes should be added. Open OBS and go to the bottom left of the screen to the “+” icon below “scenes.” Add a “recording” scenario to the mix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-scenes.jpg"                      alt="add scenes"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Customize the Recording</strong></p><p>Users should go to the Output tab and set the Video Bitrate to 6000 Kbps, Encoder to Hardware, and Audio Bitrate to 256 after entering the settings. Users may also adjust the location of their recording by choosing the save path location in the same settings tab., in the “recording” scene, click the “+” sign below “sources” on the bottom left of the screen, and add a “display capture.” If you have more than one monitor, specify which one you wish to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-tab.jpg"                      alt="output tab"                ></p><p>You may add a “Video Capture Device” to capture your webcam and an “Audio Input Capture” to gather the sounds from your microphone if you wish to. The next step is for users to go to the Audio tab and deactivate Desktop Audio. Users may add an audio input device, such as a microphone, by setting the Mic&#x2F;Auxiliary device under the same tab.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Setup the Recording</strong></p><p>Now, in the bottom left corner of the screen, click the “Scene” button, and then tap the Add icon next to the scene tab under the sources tab. A drop-down menu will display after selecting the add button, enabling you to add Game Capture and Audio Output Capture. Two more tabs will appear under the sources tab, which must be set. Choose a shooting location as well as a video type. Finally, pick “recording format” and “mp4” (or any other file type) from the drop-down menu. In the “Best Parameters for OBS Recordings,” we’ll go over various additional variables that need to be modified to ensure high-quality outputs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p><p>Users may start recording their gameplay by hitting the “Start Recording” button on the bottom-right of OBS Studio when everything is set up.
