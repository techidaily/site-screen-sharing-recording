In order to disable this rotation effect, follow the same steps and this time, uncheck Transform and Rotate options.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135410/19272" target="_top" id="2135410">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135410" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135410/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It captures either still pictures or motion videos of users, which can then be uploaded or streamed via the internet. Today, most laptops come with a built-in webcam, embedded into the display. Other webcams are small cameras that either attach to a monitor or sit on a desk and connect to a computer’s USB or FireWire port.

Boasting a number of quirky features, such as multi-user functionality and a virus-free operating system based on Linux, Chromebooks even showcase the ability to allow users to capture screenshots in a number of different manners with ease. Within this article we’ve composed a 6-section guide on how to take a screenshot on a Chromebook, as well as how to edit them, at the touch of a button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="1-Taking-Screenshots-on-a-Chromebook-with-a-Keyboard"><a href="#1-Taking-Screenshots-on-a-Chromebook-with-a-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="1. Taking Screenshots on a Chromebook with a Keyboard"></a>1. Taking Screenshots on a Chromebook with a Keyboard</h2><p>Similar to the typical CTRL + PrtScn or PrtScn shortcut used on most Window’s PCs, or the Command + Control + Shift + 3 shortcut used on Mac devices, taking screenshots with the use of a keyboard on a Chromebook is equally as straight forward. To capture a screenshot of the entire screen, the process requires the use of the <strong>Windows Switcher Key</strong> (look for 3 layered rectangles that resemble open tabs&#x2F;windows) – this is generally located above the number 6 and 7 keys and close to the screen-brightness toggles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-keyboard-screenshot.jpg"                      alt=" Chromebook Screenshot"                ></p><p>The command “**Ctrl + *Windows Switcher Key*<strong>” will capture a screenshot of your current page, and the command “</strong>Ctrl + Shift + *Windows Switcher Key***” will allow users to capture a partial screenshot with the help from a handy drag-selector tool.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If your keyboard doesn’t seem to have the Screen Switcher key, <strong>try using F5 instead</strong>. To ensure your screenshot is copied into a specific document, select “<strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong>”. From here, you’ll be able to paste directly into a document.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037345/7443" target="_top" id="2037345">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037345" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037345/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-Side-Buttons"><a href="#2-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-Side-Buttons" class="headerlink" title="2.

If so, then there’s also a handy way to make use of the screenshot feature whilst on the go. Similar to the function offered on most Smart Phone Devices, simply press both the <strong>Power and Volume Down Side Button</strong> to capture a screenshot. Unfortunately, this feature is only useful if you’re looking to capture your entire screen; you’ll need to utilize the keyboard or stylus if you’re planning to crop out a specific section.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> No matter whether you’re utilizing the Chromebook in either landscape or portrait mode, the Volume Rockers still remain in the same orientation, so it’s worth noting which button relates to “Volume Down”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1630055">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1630055.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-1630055">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1630055.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fcaperobbin.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1630055%2F18460'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1630055/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-a-Stylus"><a href="#3-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-a-Stylus" class="headerlink" title="3.

Simply remove the stylus from the Chromebook and select the “<strong>Capture</strong> <strong>Screen</strong>” option from the <strong>Stylus Tool Menu</strong> (located on the lower task bar) to capture the whole screen. If you’re aiming to just capture a specific area, then simply select the “<strong>Capture Region</strong>” option. This option will allow users to highlight the particular area they’re looking to screenshot.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/977686/11832" target="_top" id="977686">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-977686" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/977686/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-a-Third-Party-App-and-Extension"><a href="#4-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-a-Third-Party-App-and-Extension" class="headerlink" title="4.

Use Windows Game DVR</h2><p>If you want to record a short clip of your gameplay instantly and share on YouTube or other online platform, you can do it easily with Game DVR option available on Xbox One.
