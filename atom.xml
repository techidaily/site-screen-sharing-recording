It allows you to record any video playing on your screen and have it uploaded and shared. The video recorded online will have to be of the standard resolution, which could be 640×480 or 800×600 and other standard definitions.

Because in this tutorial we are going to show you how to use Zoom breakout rooms during meetings you host on this app.</p><ul><li><a href="#what_is_breakout_room">Part 1: What is a Breakout Room in Zoom?</a></li><li><a href="#create_zoom_breakout_room">Part 2: How to Create a Breakout Room?</a></li><li><a href="#manage_zoom_breakout_rooom">Part 3: How to Manage Breakout Rooms?</a></li><li><a href="#record_breakout_room">Part 4: How to Record Breakout Rooms meetings?</a></li><li><a href="#zoom-breakout-room_faq">Part 5: Troubleshooting Zoom Breakout Rooms</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Breakout-Room-in-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Breakout-Room-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Breakout Room in Zoom?"></a>Part 1: What is a Breakout Room in Zoom?</h2><p>A breakout room is a sub-room that can be created during a meeting and you can split a meeting into up to 50 breakout sessions. The app allows you to choose if you want to create these sub-rooms and split the participants in a meeting into smaller groups automatically or manually.</p><p>You must purchase the Large Meeting add-on if you would like to create 50 breakout sessions that have as many as two hundred participants. Each participant in a breakout session has complete control over video, audio and screen sharing options, and they can record each breakroom locally. In case the meeting’s host has enabled the cloud recording feature, Zoom will only record the main room while giving the participants the option to record the breakout room separately.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Breakout-Room"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Breakout-Room" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create a Breakout Room?"></a>Part 2: How to Create a Breakout Room?</h2><h3 id="1-Enable-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom"><a href="#1-Enable-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="1.

Locate the Breakout Room feature that is located in the Meeting tab and if the feature is disabled you should click on it to toggle it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eable-breakout-room-zoom.jpg"                      alt="Enable Breakout Rooms in Zoom"                ></p><p>Hosts who would like to assign participants to breakout rooms while scheduling a meeting should click on the Allow host to assign participants to breakout rooms when scheduling a checkbox.

Head over to the User Management menu, click on the Group Management option and then select the group in which you would like to enable breakout rooms.</p><p>Click on the Settings tab, navigate to the Meetings tab and click on the Breakout Room feature. You can then proceed to enable this option the same way you would enable it if you were setting up a regular Zoom meeting.</p><p>Zoom also allows account administrators and account members to activate the breakout room feature. You should click on the Settings option if you are accessing a Zoom account as an account member or go to the Account Management and pick the Account Settings option if you are accessing a Zoom account as an account administrator.</p><p>Afterward, you should just enable the breakout room option from the Meetings tab and decide if you want to pre-assign members to particular rooms while scheduling a meeting.</p><h3 id="2-Create-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#2-Create-Breakout-Rooms-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="2.

Let’s take a look at some of the most common issues Zoom users encounter with breakout rooms.</p><h3 id="1-Why-can’t-I-join-a-Zoom-Breakout-Room"><a href="#1-Why-can’t-I-join-a-Zoom-Breakout-Room" class="headerlink" title="1.

Each external monitor will display identical images when turned on, but in order to move software windows between the two screens, you’ll have to enable the ‘Extend These Displays’ option. The actual steps you’ll need to take may vary, depending on the computer and the OS you are using, and we are going to show you how to extend displays on Windows 8 or later.</p><p>Head over to the Start Menu, and open the Control Panel. Select the ‘Adjust Screen Resolution’ option in the Appearance and Personalization menu, and then click on the Multiple Displays drop-down menu. Pick the ‘Extend These Displays’ option from the list and proceed to save the changes by clicking on the OK button.</p><h3 id="Recording-Multiple-Monitors-With-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Recording-Multiple-Monitors-With-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Recording Multiple Monitors With OBS Studio"></a>Recording Multiple Monitors With OBS Studio</h3><p>Widely accepted as one of the best open-source broadcasting and screen recording software ever created, OBS Studio also enables its users to record multiple screens simultaneously. The plug-in for the OBS called Simple Scene Switcher that detects on which monitor the mouse cursor is and that automatically switches between two monitors as you drag a mouse is a great option if you don’t want to record multiple displays at the same time. The plug-in lets you switch between windows without disrupting the flow of the video, which makes it particularly useful for LoL players and in numerous other situations. Here’s how you can record multiple monitors with OBS.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display"><a href="#Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Adding a Second Display"></a>Step 1 - Adding a Second Display</h4><p>Once you launch the software, you should use the right-click to access the software’s drop-down menu. Locate the Add feature and select the Display Capture option. Create&#x2F;Select Source window will pop-up, hit OK and once the Properties window appears on screen you should select your second monitor form the Display drop-down list. A new screen will emerge on the screen, and you can simply drag it to reposition it where you want.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Adjusting-the-Resolution"><a href="#Step-2-Adjusting-the-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Adjusting the Resolution"></a>Step 2 - Adjusting the Resolution</h4><p>Go to OBS Studio’s main window and click on the Settings button in the lower right corner of the window. Select the Video option from the Settings menu, and then expand the Base (Canvas) Resolution bar.</p><p>Sum up the two values of the wider sides of the screens and insert the value you get into the Base Resolution bar. For example, if one monitor has a 1366X768 resolution and the second one has a 1024X768 resolution, you should add 1024 to the 1366 and insert the resulting value (2390) as the wide resolution value in Base Resolution Bar.</p><p>Save the changes you’ve made, and then drag the screens to arrange them. You can start recording multiple monitors with OBS Studio by clicking on the Start Recording button.</p><h3 id="Capturing-Multiple-Monitor-Displays-with-Camtasia"><a href="#Capturing-Multiple-Monitor-Displays-with-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="Capturing Multiple Monitor Displays with Camtasia"></a>Capturing Multiple Monitor Displays with Camtasia</h3><p>Selecting more than one monitor from the Camtasia’s Fullscreen settings is unfortunately not possible, but the Custom recording settings option allows you to capture footage from two different displays. You’ll need to make sure that both monitors are properly aligned and the that Extend These Displays feature is selected. Here’s how you record multiple monitors with Camtasia.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Setting-up-the-Screen-Recording-Session-on-Multiple-Monitors"><a href="#Step-1-Setting-up-the-Screen-Recording-Session-on-Multiple-Monitors" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Setting up the Screen Recording Session on Multiple Monitors"></a>Step 1 - Setting up the Screen Recording Session on Multiple Monitors</h4><p>Click on the Custom drop-down menu in Camtasia’s main window., and then click on the Select area to record option and proceed to designate the area of the multiple screens you want to record. You can accomplish this by clicking the left mouse button and dragging the boundary handles. Making the adjustments to the initial selections is also possible, even after you let go of the mouse key, but not during the screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Recording-and-Editing-the-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Recording-and-Editing-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Recording and Editing the Video"></a>Step 2 - Recording and Editing the Video</h4><p>Camtasia allows you to capture system audio, record sound from an external microphone, as well as to adjust the frame rate or the video resolution of the screen recording you are making. Hit the Record button when you are ready to start capturing footage from multiple monitors. The file you’ve created will be displayed in the software’s video editing mode, after the screencasting session is over, so you can remove unwanted parts of the video or add visual and text effects to your video.</p><h4 id="Tips-for-Recording-Multiple-Monitors"><a href="#Tips-for-Recording-Multiple-Monitors" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Recording Multiple Monitors"></a>Tips for Recording Multiple Monitors</h4><p>Creating <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recordings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in high resolutions will use up a lot of the computer’s RAM memory, which can destabilize Camtasia’s video editor and cause it to crash. What’s more, if your computer doesn’t have a good graphics card, a lot of RAM memory and a great processor, the multiple monitor screen recordings may have a lag or even dropped frames. That’s the reason why you should make sure that your computer configuration is capable of capturing smooth screen recordings from multiple monitors, before starting your first screencasting session with multiple monitors.</p><p>In case that you want to record your secondary monitor, we recommend you to try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"

Most Mac users never have the need to change this setting, because they can always move the file to a folder where they want to store it. On the other hand, creating a lot of screenshots every day can make a chaos on your desktop. Luckily changing the destination where your screenshots are saved is a simple process that lets you decide where your images will be stored.</p><p>Here’s how you can change the location where the screenshots you take using the keyboard shortcuts will be saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac"></a>Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac</h2><p>Changing the folder where you store your screenshots is not an irreversible process, which means that you can reset the destination where the files are saved to Desktop at any point. Do not delete the new folder, because your Mac may not be able to take screenshots, afterward. The process described below is the only way you can delete a folder or add a new destination for your screenshots, and failing to comply with it may cause your Mac to malfunction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal.jpg"                      alt="Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>Create a new folder on the desired location on your hard drive, and then launch Terminal, by typing Terminal in the Search Box and clicking on its icon. Once the app is open, you should insert the following command into the Terminal window:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location</strong></p><p>Then enter a space at the end after ‘location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal-settings.jpg"                      alt="Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>The next step is to add the new location at which screenshots will be saved and you can do this by simply dragging the folder you created into Terminal and adding it at the end of the command you just entered. A path is created and the command line should now contain the folder’s unique location and it should look like this:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;username&#x2F;Screenshots</strong></p><p>To execute the command you have to press Enter. After Terminal finishes running the command, its window will appear on the screen again. You should proceed to confirm the changes you’ve just made by resetting the User Interface on your computer. In order to do so, you’ll have to insert this command below the one you previously entered：</p><p><strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong></p><p>Hit Enter once more to confirm the changes and run the new command. Close Terminal app by clicking on the Terminal menu and selecting the Quick Terminal option. The default location where the screenshots are saved on your Mac is now changed and every time you take a screenshot using the Command + Shift + 3 shortcut the file will be saved at the new location. If for whatever reason you want to make the Desktop once again the destination where the screenshots on your computer will be saved here’s how you can do it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop"></a>Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop</h2><p>The process of changing the default screenshot save location back to Desktop is nearly identical to the process we just described. You just have to open the Terminal app and insert the following command into the prompt.</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screen capture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Username&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;</strong></p><p>Make sure that your username is properly written, and then press Enter to run the command. Now you only have to reset the UI so it can recognize the changes you’ve made, and you can do it by inserting the <strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong> command into the Terminal window and pressing Enter to execute it.</p><p>Don’t forget that deleting the folder you use as a default location for storing screenshots should only be done using the process we just described in the Terminal application, since all other methods may cause unnecessary trouble.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-essential-tools-for-perfect-linux-screenshots-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Tools for Perfect Linux Screenshots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-winscreening-prospects-a-comprehensively-ranked-recorder-list/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Winscreening Prospects  A Comprehensively Ranked Recorder List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/pc-games-memory-freeze-and-capture-6-ways-to-win-for-2024/"><u>PC Games Memory - Freeze and Capture 6 Ways to Win for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-perfecting-your-performance-logging-the-ultimate-guide-for-capturing-roblox-on-a-mac/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Perfecting Your Performance Logging  The Ultimate Guide for Capturing Roblox on a Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-10-hits-you-cant-miss-on-spotify/"><u>2024 Approved  10 Hits You Can’t Miss on Spotify</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/proven-strategies-in-advanced-obs-studio-filmmaking/"><u>Proven Strategies in Advanced OBS Studio Filmmaking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-primary-tape-scrutiny-study-summary/"><u>[New] In 2024, Primary Tape Scrutiny Study Summary</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-exclusive-deals-on-free-professional-discord-icons/"><u>[Updated] Exclusive Deals on Free, Professional Discord Icons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/10-essential-animation-software-for-modern-education/"><u>10 Essential Animation Software for Modern Education</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-picart-anonymizer-swiftly-hide-identities/"><u>In 2024, PicArt Anonymizer  Swiftly Hide Identities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-5-tracking-apps-to-track-meizu-21-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 5 Tracking Apps to Track Meizu 21 without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-effortless-internet-ranking-the-best-7-android-adblockers-now/"><u>[New] Effortless Internet  Ranking the Best 7 Android AdBlockers Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-vimeos-video-segments-the-chapter-creation-handbook-for-2024/"><u>[New] Vimeo's Video Segments  The Chapter Creation Handbook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-explaining-the-gopro-burst-mode/"><u>2024 Approved  Explaining the GoPro Burst Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-10-best-tools-to-bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-6s-plus-you-should-try-out-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, The 10 Best Tools to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock On iPhone 6s Plus You Should Try Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-unveiling-30-preferred-steadicam-models-for-high-quality-dslr-projects/"><u>In 2024, Unveiling 30 Preferred Steadicam Models for High-Quality DSLR Projects</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Becoming-the-Ultimate-Streamer-on-YouTube-and-Twitch-Using-OBS"><a href="#Becoming-the-Ultimate-Streamer-on-YouTube-and-Twitch-Using-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Becoming the Ultimate Streamer on YouTube and Twitch Using OBS"></a>Becoming the Ultimate Streamer on YouTube and Twitch Using OBS</h2><h2 id="Part-1-Introduction"><a href="#Part-1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Introduction"></a>Part 1: Introduction</h2><p>If you want to enhance your audience reach, consider multi-streaming to Twitch and your other preferred sites. Mainstreaming enables you to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube or stream on Twitch and Facebook, or all three! At the same time, with everyone spending more time indoors amid the global crisis, it appears we’re all seeking a diversion and many gamers are asking themselves how to broadcast on YouTube or Twitch. One of the easiest methods to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube Gaming at the same time is via OBS. Streamers may broadcast to more than 30 streaming platforms concurrently using an easy-to-understand user interface. The service is created in a manner that won’t place any demand on your PC hardware or the bandwidth you have available.</p><p>Well, it all boils down to choosing. But if you want to know the streaming networks with the highest traffic, those platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming. Twitch is a mainstreaming service that enables you to broadcast on more than 30 of your favorite platforms simultaneously. It merely takes a few minutes to join your numerous live streaming accounts and interact directly with the popular encoding program OBS. You may also multi streams on Twitch and your other favorite streaming services. Knowing what the correct gear is when you’re starting as a streamer may be intimidating, but we come with good news. Nowadays the entry-level for streaming has reduced quite a bit owing to hardware becoming more affordable, but also because many PCs are already prepared to manage a broadcast or can be readily updated to support one.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS"></a>Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS</h2><p>If you want to obtain the very greatest quality broadcast, you’re searching for some fantastic software. In the case of Windows, one of the most common solutions is Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) (OBS). Many people are first drawn to OBS since it’s free to use owing to being open source. Luckily, it’s also a feature-rich piece of software that can handle practically anything you throw at it. If you’re new to OBS or to streaming in general, it might be a bit frightening at first.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch"><a href="#Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch"></a>Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch</h3><p>Before you stream anything anyplace, you need to provide OBS with the credentials to broadcast on your channel. Exactly how you do this on the large number of services OBS supports may differ, but I’m covering Twitch for this instruction.</p><p>In all circumstances, you need to either produce a stream key in your account settings on the appropriate provider or link your account to OBS if it’s supported like it is on Twitch. Simply signing in with your credentials is by far the simplest approach, and OBS utilizes streaming, so you’re not providing any of your personal login information directly to it. YouTube likewise offers a similar kind of authentication.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch.jpg"                      alt="twitch"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS"><a href="#Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS"></a>Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS</h3><p>OBS Studio is available for all main operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS, and, Linux. You may get the utility by clicking here. Run and install the software to get started. When you launch the program for the first time, OBS Studio performs an Auto-Configuration Wizard. It provides you the choice of selecting between ‘Optimize for streaming’ and ‘Optimize for recording’. Click on the ‘Optimize for streaming’ if you wish to live broadcast your game. The wizard will next examine your system’s performance. It examines and helps adjust your system resolution, bitrate, encoder, and internet connection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/installing-and-setting-obs.jpg"                      alt="installing and setting obs"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Configuring-OBS-Studio-for-Streaming-to-Twitch"><a href="#Step-3-Configuring-OBS-Studio-for-Streaming-to-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Configuring OBS Studio for Streaming to Twitch"></a>Step 3. Configuring OBS Studio for Streaming to Twitch</h3><p>Now that you’re set up to the stream, the first step is to select your resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. The greater each of them, the more bandwidth and horsepower you’ll require from your PC. If you’ve got a high-speed internet connection and a strong PC, then you can probably stream at 1080p60 at a high bitrate. But you also need to balance this with offering a stream that’s not going to buffer like wild for your viewers who could be on poorer connections. Remember, if you’re not a partner on Twitch, you won’t have transcoding, thus the experience might be awful for viewers with sluggish connections.</p><p>Once you’re done setting up OBS, you can dig into the advanced capabilities such as OBS sceneries. These will allow you to dramatically boost your live stream production value. If you arrange your OBS scenes and sources appropriately, your broadcast may go from an ordinary-looking stream to one that appears slick and professional.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configuring-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configuring obs studio"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources"><a href="#Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step 4.

However, is <strong>Ezvid screen recorder</strong> the best software available or is there a better alternative you can opt for? In this article, we will explain the features of Ezvid and how to use Ezvid recorder. Thereafter, we will recommend a better alternative tool for screen recording.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">Key Features of Ezvid</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">How to Use Ezvid Screen Recorder</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Alternative Tool to Record Screen</a></p><h2 id="1-Key-Features-of-Ezvid"><a href="#1-Key-Features-of-Ezvid" class="headerlink" title="1. Key Features of Ezvid"></a>1. Key Features of Ezvid</h2><p>Ezvid video maker is a great screen recording software and here are the features that the software has to offer to satisfy all the requirements of the video creators.</p><p><strong>Record Screen and Facecam</strong></p><p>Ezvid is an incredible screen recorder to capture your desktop screen as well as browser screen. The user interface is clean and there is a direct option available to start recording the entire screen. Moreover, there are advanced options available such as capturing a region of the screen instead of the entire screen.</p><p>Besides, you can record Facecam which is extremely important for video creators who show the screen as well as their face on the same video simultaneously. This makes the video more relatable and professional. Therefore, apart from recording the entire or part of the screen, you can record from the webcam and both the capturing is put together in the same video.</p><p><strong>Instant Screen Drawing</strong></p><p>Instead of waiting for the screen recording to get over and editing the recorded video to add drawings, you can add the required drawings live while recording the screen with Ezvid screen recorder. This simple feature is going to save you a lot of time as there is no further editing required. There are ample drawings available to illustrate on the screen and draw the attention of the viewers in the highlighted areas.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Recording</strong></p><p>Apart from recording desktop screen as well as browser screen, there is a special and dedicated feature to capture the screen while playing games. The software comes with guided instructions on how to record gameplay for complete user convenience. Professional gamers may not get all the customization options but Ezvid gets the job done perfectly. After recording the game screen, you can edit the video and upload it on social media and video streaming platforms.</p><p><strong>Free Music Addition</strong></p><p>One of the main reasons why a good-quality video stands out from a basic video is the background music. You will find only a few screen recorders and video editors to add free music in the background of the video as per your preference and requirements. This makes the video soothing and pleasant to the ears rather than just being pleasant to the eyes. There is no need to search online for free music to add to your screen recordings as you can find suitable music for your video from Ezvid library.</p><p><strong>Control Video Speed</strong></p><p>You know how important it is to regulate video speed so that the crucial moments are recorded at a slow speed while not so important parts can be at a high speed. There are only a few screen recorders available that allow users to control video speed. This is a necessary feature professional video creators always look for in a screen recording and video editing software.</p><p><strong>Instant Slideshow Maker -</strong></p><p>Instead of making and editing videos all the time, you can also use Ezvid to make slideshows using screenshots and photos. There are beautiful transitions and effects available and you can add texts and drawings. You can make the slideshows instantly and share them with anyone on any platform. Therefore, Ezvid video maker can be used as a screen recorder as well as slideshow maker.</p><p>Besides, you can add voice over to the recorded video to make it more professional and interesting.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-Ezvid-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-Ezvid-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Use Ezvid Screen Recorder"></a>2. How to Use Ezvid Screen Recorder</h2><p>Ezvid screen recorder is easy to use and it is perfect for beginners as well. It is important to note that Ezvid is available only for Windows users. If you are using Mac, you can check out the best alternative in the next section. Ezvid for Windows is compatible with Windows XP to Windows 10. Here are the steps to follow to record the screen with Ezvid.</p><p>Step 1: Download and Install Ezvid from the official website of Ezvid for Windows.</p><p>Step 2: Launch Ezvid and click on Capture Screen option (monitor icon) located at the bottom-right corner as you can see on the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezvid-screen-capture.jpg"                      alt="run ezvid recorder"                ></p><p>Step 3: This will start recording the entire screen.

Moreover, Filmora not just allows inserting of drawings but also captions and stickers. To sum it all up, Filmora is literally more professional for all perspectives, and therefore, Wondershare Filmora is the best alternative to Ezvid video maker.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your PC.

Key Features of Ezvid"></a>1. Key Features of Ezvid</h2><p>Ezvid video maker is a great screen recording software and here are the features that the software has to offer to satisfy all the requirements of the video creators.</p><p><strong>Record Screen and Facecam</strong></p><p>Ezvid is an incredible screen recorder to capture your desktop screen as well as browser screen. The user interface is clean and there is a direct option available to start recording the entire screen. Moreover, there are advanced options available such as capturing a region of the screen instead of the entire screen.</p><p>Besides, you can record Facecam which is extremely important for video creators who show the screen as well as their face on the same video simultaneously. This makes the video more relatable and professional. Therefore, apart from recording the entire or part of the screen, you can record from the webcam and both the capturing is put together in the same video.</p><p><strong>Instant Screen Drawing</strong></p><p>Instead of waiting for the screen recording to get over and editing the recorded video to add drawings, you can add the required drawings live while recording the screen with Ezvid screen recorder. This simple feature is going to save you a lot of time as there is no further editing required. There are ample drawings available to illustrate on the screen and draw the attention of the viewers in the highlighted areas.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Recording</strong></p><p>Apart from recording desktop screen as well as browser screen, there is a special and dedicated feature to capture the screen while playing games. The software comes with guided instructions on how to record gameplay for complete user convenience. Professional gamers may not get all the customization options but Ezvid gets the job done perfectly. After recording the game screen, you can edit the video and upload it on social media and video streaming platforms.</p><p><strong>Free Music Addition</strong></p><p>One of the main reasons why a good-quality video stands out from a basic video is the background music. You will find only a few screen recorders and video editors to add free music in the background of the video as per your preference and requirements. This makes the video soothing and pleasant to the ears rather than just being pleasant to the eyes. There is no need to search online for free music to add to your screen recordings as you can find suitable music for your video from Ezvid library.</p><p><strong>Control Video Speed</strong></p><p>You know how important it is to regulate video speed so that the crucial moments are recorded at a slow speed while not so important parts can be at a high speed. There are only a few screen recorders available that allow users to control video speed. This is a necessary feature professional video creators always look for in a screen recording and video editing software.</p><p><strong>Instant Slideshow Maker -</strong></p><p>Instead of making and editing videos all the time, you can also use Ezvid to make slideshows using screenshots and photos. There are beautiful transitions and effects available and you can add texts and drawings. You can make the slideshows instantly and share them with anyone on any platform. Therefore, Ezvid video maker can be used as a screen recorder as well as slideshow maker.</p><p>Besides, you can add voice over to the recorded video to make it more professional and interesting.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-Ezvid-Screen-Recorder-2"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-Ezvid-Screen-Recorder-2" class="headerlink" title="2.
