If you do not have a high-end computer, you are likely to face Encoding Overloaded issue while using OBS Studio. High encoding problem is rather common in OBS Studio because video recording and streaming demand high system resources which your computer is unable to meet.</p><p>In layman’s terms, encoding overloading means your hardware is just not running as fast as required to process the video you are streaming or recording. Since you cannot change your hardware configuration overnight, here are the different ways you can fix OBS high encoding when streaming.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130870/7443" target="_top" id="2130870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Way 1\. Downscale Your Output Resolution<p>The higher the resolution of the video recording or streaming, the greater will be the CPU usage. This is because your processor has to process more number of pixels per frame. That is why you have to lower the output resolution of your video. Even when your base resolution is high, you have to cut down the output resolution. Base resolution is the resolution of the video at source which could be the game you are playing. The output resolution is the resolution of the video you are getting after recording or you are streaming in real-time. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will have to look for Output (Scaled) Resolution option.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce the resolution from the current resolution. If it is at 1920 x 1080p, you have to bring it down to 1280 x 720p.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok buttons. Restart your computer and start streaming or recording again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137214/26400" target="_top" id="2137214">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137214" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137214/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Way 2\. Lower Your Frame Rate<p>The frame rate of a video determines the number of frames captured per second. The higher the frame rate, the greater will be the pressure on GPU to render more number of frames per second. Unless you have a powerful configuration, you will come across OBS high encoding when streaming if the frame rate is high such as 60FPS. Here are the steps to lower the frame rate of your video on OBS.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Video tab and look for Common FPS Values option.</p><p>Step 3: If it is set to 60, you have to bring it down to 30. Basically, you have to reduce the current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the new setting. Restart your computer and resume your OBS operation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-click-on-apply-and-ok-button.jpg"                      alt="obs click on apply and ok button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098700/14409" target="_top" id="2098700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098700/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Way 3\. Change Encoder Preset<p>By default, OBS uses x264 as encoder and the encoder preset is set to “veryfast”. This is generally the best and most balanced setting. However, if you are getting OBS high encoding warning, you have to change the encoder preset to reduce the CPU usage. Generally, the higher the preset, the lower is CPU usage. Therefore, you have to set the preset from “veryfast” to “ultrafast” and here are the steps.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and make sure that the encoder is Software(x264).</p><p>Step 3: Turn on Enable Advanced Encoder Settings option.</p><p>Step 4: Change the Encoder Preset from Veryfast to Ultrafast.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button. Restart your computer and perform your action on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-encoder-preset.jpg"                      alt="obs change encoder preset"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304647">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304647%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304647/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Way 4\. Try Hardware Encoding<p>You can try out different hardware encoders available such as Quicksync, AMF, or NVENC. The availability of different hardware encoders depends on your computer hardware configuration. These hardware encoders are better than the default x264 encoder as they use less CPU resources. Since the issue is primarily with encoder, you should try changing the encoder and see if the problem is fixed.</p><p>Step 1: On OBS, you will have to go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Output tab and set Output Mode to Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Streaming tab, and check all the encoders available.</p><p>Step 4: Change the encoder from default x264 to any other hardware encoder available.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok to save the settings. Restart your computer and perform your operation on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-restart-your-computer-and-perform-your-operation.jpg"                      alt="obs restart your computer and perform your operation"                ></p><h2 id="Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings"><a href="#Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings"></a>Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings</h2><p>If you are still facing OBS high encoding problem, you need to change some advanced settings in order to fix this encoder overloaded issue. You can change the keyframe interval so that your processor gets enough time for rendering. Similarly, you can change Rate Control from Constant to Variable so that the video does not demand high bandwidth.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and set Output Mode as Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: From Streaming tab, change Keyframe Interval and set it to 2 from zero.</p><p>Step 4: Change Rate Control from CBR to VBR.</p><p>Step 5: Change Profile from None to Main.</p><p>Step 6: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the changes. Restart your computer and check if the problem is resolved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-open-and-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs open and go to settings"                ></p><h2 id="Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative"><a href="#Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Way 6. Use OBS Alternative"></a>Way 6. Use OBS Alternative</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned ways can solve the constant encoding overloaded warning you are receiving while using OBS Studio for recording or streaming, you have to opt for an alternative. Wondershare Filmora is the best alternative to OBS for recording screen and webcam. Filmora does not affect the CPU performance as significantly as OBS Studio does.

The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better.

The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others.

Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software.

There are surely going to be times when you wish you could download the streaming audio and save it on your hard drive for listening to them anytime offline. Instead of playing a music video online and wasting your internet data, you can just record the audio part from the video and listen to it offline. In fact, you may want to record online live streams of podcasts before they disappear forever. That is where an online stream recorder can come in handy.</p><p>Most streaming platforms do not have a download option for copyright reasons and for retaining online users. You can record streaming audio online from any audio and even video playing online. You can listen to the recordings repeatedly without consuming internet data. You can share them directly with others instead of sharing the link. You can even trim parts and use them in your videos.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Strategic-Giants-Identifying-the-Prime-7-Total-War-Battles"><a href="#Strategic-Giants-Identifying-the-Prime-7-Total-War-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Strategic Giants: Identifying the Prime 7 Total War Battles"></a>Strategic Giants: Identifying the Prime 7 Total War Battles</h2><p>It’s a tough task to choose the best total war games. Everyone has a favorite—the game that first introduced them to the series or allowed them to immerse themselves in a historical era they’d always been fascinated with. When you find a historical era you didn’t even know much about, as I did through Shogun 2 &amp; Three Kingdoms, it sparks your interest.</p><p>Warhammer 3 introduces survival combat, a fresh Three Kingdoms game is announced, Saga: Troy tries mythology on it for size, the franchise is expanding in more ways than ever before. Classics, though, are still available. One of the most compelling aspects is that, despite their differences, they all have a sense of cohesiveness. You can dive into anything and always find something in common.</p><p>For many individuals, Total War has a special place in their hearts, and it’s always enjoyable to go back and play games from the series whenever the mood strikes. I’m constantly attracted back to films like Attila, Fall of the Samurai, and Rome 2, to name a few.

I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><h3 id="4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall"><a href="#4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall" class="headerlink" title="4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall"></a>4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></p><p>Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game.

Medieval 2 is essentially the same game as Medieval 1, but with improved visuals, updated gameplay, and additional features. Who'd have guessed that would suffice?<p>Of course, Medieval 2 has many of the same flaws as Rome, such as bad AI and pathfinding, but because there was no remake, it remains a game set in its period that is still remarkable even when compared with some of the most recent best total war games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Campaign mode.</p><p>• Battle focused.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135362/19272" target="_top" id="2135362">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135362" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135362/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 7.Shogun 2: Total War<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shogun2-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="shogun2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Finally, the apex of Total War, the meeting point and turning point among older and newer era Total Wars, and the example of Creative Assemblies at its height. While Shogun 2 isn’t exactly a AAA cost game (I’d call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games’ large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.</p><p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun.

Rome 2 had a disastrous debut, similar to Empire, and it took a year for it to become genuinely playable. CA, on the other hand, stuck it out and won their first genuine AAA Total War.</p><p>Apart from the largely forgotten rough launch problems and many contentious design choices, Rome 2 has left an unresolved black stain on the Total War series that still exists today: chronic feature stripping, particularly in multiplayer. Regardless, Rome 2 is a fascinating revisit to Ancient Rome, though it took a long time to get there—after all, Rome was not built in a day.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gore &amp; Blood.</p><p>• State of Greek culture pack.</p><p>• Raider and Pirates culture pack.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134497/18498" target="_top" id="2134497">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134497" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134497/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 3.Three Kingdoms: Total War<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-kingdom-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="three-kingdom-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Three Kingdoms has been the most recent mainline of the best total war games, and in my opinion, it’s also the most honest. The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938136">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938136">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938136%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938136/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424527">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424527">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424527%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424527/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game. Fall of the Samurai (later renamed as a Saga game) was released as a standalone addition for Shogun 2, transporting players to the lesser-known Meiji Restoration era in Japanese history, when pro-Imperial and pro-Shogunate armies fought for Japan's destiny.<p>As close-quarters oriented samurai fight against and besides modern firearms-equipped soldiers, the campaign’s theme of tradition vs. modernity creates intriguing combat dynamics. This gives the tactical gameplay a fascinating twist and complexity that matches Shogun 2’s meticulous balance. The fall of the Samurai is certainly worth checking out as a historical development and improvement of Shogun 2.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic Clash.</p><p>• Modern weaponry.</p><p>• Explosive power.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123477/16836" target="_top" id="2123477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123477/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 5.Warhammer 2<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warhammer2-poster.jpg"                      alt="warhammer2-poster"                ></p><p>With a stronger narrative emphasis and more engaging factions and systems, Warhammer 2 builds on the original’s legacy and influence of the best total war games series.</p><p>Warhammer 2 has all of the features that made Warhammer so popular, as well as tweaks to the balance and additional post-release material and updates.

This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun. At the time of its release, Attila’s primary goal was to fix Rome 2’s flaws and stripped-down features, since it seemed like the game was going down the same road as Empire. Attila, on the other hand, proved to be more than that, because it not only reintroduced promised features but also innovated, iterated, and expanded the brand.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic perspective.</p><p>• Ominous franchise.</p><h3 id="2-Rome-2-Total-War-3"><a href="#2-Rome-2-Total-War-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Rome 2 Total War"></a>2.Rome 2 Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rome-2-total-war-poster.png"                      alt="rome-2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike its predecessor, Rome 2, which was released in 2004, the time has been very kind with Rome 2 &amp;, as a consequence, it may be called a surprise success for CA. Rome 2 had a disastrous debut, similar to Empire, and it took a year for it to become genuinely playable. CA, on the other hand, stuck it out and won their first genuine AAA Total War.</p><p>Apart from the largely forgotten rough launch problems and many contentious design choices, Rome 2 has left an unresolved black stain on the Total War series that still exists today: chronic feature stripping, particularly in multiplayer. Regardless, Rome 2 is a fascinating revisit to Ancient Rome, though it took a long time to get there—after all, Rome was not built in a day.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gore &amp; Blood.</p><p>• State of Greek culture pack.</p><p>• Raider and Pirates culture pack.</p><h3 id="3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War-2"><a href="#3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War-2" class="headerlink" title="3.Three Kingdoms: Total War"></a>3.Three Kingdoms: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-kingdom-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="three-kingdom-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Three Kingdoms has been the most recent mainline of the best total war games, and in my opinion, it’s also the most honest. The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><h3 id="4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall-1"><a href="#4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall-1" class="headerlink" title="4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall"></a>4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></p><p>Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game. Fall of the Samurai (later renamed as a Saga game) was released as a standalone addition for Shogun 2, transporting players to the lesser-known Meiji Restoration era in Japanese history, when pro-Imperial and pro-Shogunate armies fought for Japan’s destiny.</p><p>As close-quarters oriented samurai fight against and besides modern firearms-equipped soldiers, the campaign’s theme of tradition vs. modernity creates intriguing combat dynamics. This gives the tactical gameplay a fascinating twist and complexity that matches Shogun 2’s meticulous balance. The fall of the Samurai is certainly worth checking out as a historical development and improvement of Shogun 2.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic Clash.</p><p>• Modern weaponry.</p><p>• Explosive power.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1265663">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1265663">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmartinic.evyy.net%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1265663%2F4482'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1265663/4482"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 5.Warhammer 2<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warhammer2-poster.jpg"                      alt="warhammer2-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139122/17108" target="_top" id="2139122">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139122" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139122/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->With a stronger narrative emphasis and more engaging factions and systems, Warhammer 2 builds on the original's legacy and influence of the best total war games series.<p>Warhammer 2 has all of the features that made Warhammer so popular, as well as tweaks to the balance and additional post-release material and updates. The Mortal Empires’ adventure, which merges the strategic landscapes from the first and two seasons into one huge super campaign, is perhaps Warhammer 2’s most significant feature. However, as a result of this, Warhammer 2 swallows the first, rendering Warhammer insignificant as a gaming experience.</p><p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Warhammer enthusiast. What’s also cool to see, particularly in the post-launch support, is that both CA &amp; Games Workshop put out the effort to create new components, whether they’re units, heroes, or mythology, and add them to the games, indicating a real interest in using this framework for franchise development. The multiplayer in Warhammer 2 is also very strong, although this is due more to a large number of generally well-defined and realized factions and races than to any specific improvements in the mode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Real time tactics.</p><p>• Strategy based.</p><p>• AI controlled factions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130870/7443" target="_top" id="2130870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 6.Total War Medieval 2<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-medieval-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="total-war-medieval-2-poster"                ></p><p>These last two entries are almost interchangeable since they are both excellent examples of best total war games, but because this is a ranking list, I’ll offer a specific response. Medieval 2 is essentially the same game as Medieval 1, but with improved visuals, updated gameplay, and additional features. Who’d have guessed that would suffice?</p><p>Of course, Medieval 2 has many of the same flaws as Rome, such as bad AI and pathfinding, but because there was no remake, it remains a game set in its period that is still remarkable even when compared with some of the most recent best total war games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Campaign mode.</p><p>• Battle focused.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 7.Shogun 2: Total War<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shogun2-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="shogun2-total-war-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130874/7443" target="_top" id="2130874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Finally, the apex of Total War, the meeting point and turning point among older and newer era Total Wars, and the example of Creative Assemblies at its height. While Shogun 2 isn't exactly a AAA cost game (I'd call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games' large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.<p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2128844/7443" target="_top" id="2128844">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2128844" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2128844/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-alternative-tools-that-outperform-sharex/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Alternative Tools That Outperform ShareX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-comprerante-guide-to-sierras-cloud-file-accessibility/"><u>[New] Comprerante Guide to Sierra's Cloud File Accessibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-water-wonders-leading-fluid-game-selections/"><u>[New] In 2024, Water Wonders Leading Fluid Game Selections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-is-magic-call-voice-changer-app-working-get-alternatives-here/"><u>[New] Is Magic Call – Voice Changer App Working?

Record Hangout Sessions on Phone<p>If you are using Google Hangouts from your phone and you want to record hangouts call and meeting sessions, we have different methods for iPhone and Android.</p><p><strong>For iPhone:</strong></p><p>If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you do not have to install any external app. This is because iOS 11 comes with an inbuilt screen recording feature. You can get access to this screen recorder from Control Center. If it is not readily available, you have to activate the feature and start recording the screen which is Hangouts calls and meetings here. Here are the steps you have to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136624/26400" target="_top" id="2136624">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136624" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136624/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Step 1: Open Settings app and go to on Control Centre.<p>Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and find Screen Recording option and turn it on.</p><p>Step 3: Open Google Hangouts app and start video call or meeting that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: Open Control Centre on your iPhone by swiping down or up as applicable.</p><p>Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you can start your Hangouts call or meeting.</p><p><strong>For Android:</strong></p><p>Android OS does not include any inbuilt screen recording option. Therefore, you have to install an external screen recording app for recording hangouts sessions. We recommend you install Mobizen screen recorder app on your Android smartphone so that you can record your Hangouts sessions as well as anything on your screen. It is a completely free app and there is no watermark issue. Here are the steps to follow to record Google Hangout with Mobizen screen recorder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mobizen-screenrecorder.jpg"                      alt="mobizen screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and install Mobizen screen recorder.</p><p>Step 2: Open Mobizen screen recorder and you will see some icons on your screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open Google Hangouts and start your video call.</p><p>Step 4: Tap on Record icon of Mobizen screen recorder on the screen to start recording.</p><p>Step 5: When you are done, tap on Stop icon on your screen.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The answer to the question “Can you record a Google hangout?” is yes.

OBS virtual camera enables you to utilize a media resource such as video files, screenshots, apps, games, etc. as the camera output to Meet, or other Video conversations. Your conference partner will see the video source you just specified instead of your face via the camera. One of the most typical concerns that streamers would run across is that their video would, over time, become out of sync with the rest of the broadcast. For example, your microphone audio could line up with your lips at first, but there is a perceptible offset from the camera one hour into a broadcast. Luckily, these video sync difficulties with OBS are generally caused by a sampling rate mismatch. Thanks to its basic well-organized user interface, OBS is pretty easy to use and it operates smoothly as well.</p><p>Assuming you are a post for freeware that can do screen recording properly and profitably, an OBS screen recorder is warmly encouraged. Even better, its outstanding ability is to cope with live spillage by supporting numerous popular web-based features. In video conferencing software like Skype, Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, or Facebook Messenger Rooms, you may notice a video source issue labeled “OBS camera not showing” in the OBS Studio.

If you have a Windows 7 or 8, then the easiest solution, is the Windows Media Center, although Windows 8 users must download this software because it is no longer a part of the built-in software package that comes with the Windows 8 OS.</p><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p>Locate the Windows Media Center on your computer’s hard drive. Chances are that you don’t have the Media Center’s icon on your desktop, so the fastest way to launch this software is to click on the Start menu, then go to All Programs and select the Windows Media Center from the list.</p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows7-record-tv.jpg"                      alt="windows 7 recording tv"                ></p><p>After you’ve successfully launched the software, scroll through its main menu and select the TV option. You should then click on the Guide feature, but before you can watch TV or record TV shows from your computer, you must first make sure that your TV Tuner Card is properly connected to your satellite or cable TV device, as well as your PC. Furthermore, if you are using the Windows Media Center for the first time, you’ll also have to go through the software’s Live TV setup procedure.</p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p>Click on the Guide feature, and browse through the TV program in order to select the TV show you’d like to record. You can use the arrow keys to navigate through the Guide and hit the Enter key to select a program and to access its info page.</p><h4 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h4><p>On the program info page, you’ll be able to see different live TV recording options, so you should proceed and select the option that best fits your current needs. If you want to start recording right away, you should simply click on the Record button, while the Record Series button will enable you to record every episode of a selected TV series to your PC’s hard-drive. In order to prevent a recording session, simply click on the Do Not Record button in the show’s info page.</p><h2 id="How-to-record-live-TV-on-Windows-10-for-free"><a href="#How-to-record-live-TV-on-Windows-10-for-free" class="headerlink" title="How to record live TV on Windows 10 for free"></a>How to record live TV on Windows 10 for free</h2><p>Although using the Windows Media Center on Windows 10 is possible, it is not recommended since it can produce needless complications. However, the Xbox Game DVR that enables its users to capture video games or record live TV is one of the best video recording software Windows 10 has to offer.</p><h4 id="Step-1-1"><a href="#Step-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p>Although you may not know it, the version of the Windows 10 you have installed on your PC features the Xbox Game DVR application. If you are not sure where exactly on your hard-disk this software is located, you can just go to the Start menu and type in Xbox in the search bar.

MediaPortal is a perfect tool that will allow you to record TV shows effortlessly and even schedule live TV recording sessions.
