One more addition to this series is more interesting where the player needs to pop the green bubbles available on the screen while saving the red ones.</p><p>You will love the graphics, background music and animations of this game.

These days, it’s all too common for gamers to have to clear their hard drives when a new game is released.</p><p>Games like Call of Duty see the astonishing patch sizes: Warzone lately may mean you can only update a game rather than get a new one, and still, you’ll run out of space. It is possible to store hundreds of games using an external hard drive, making them available to you without downloading them again.</p><p>You will still need more storage, though an SSD is more efficient and recommended if you buy the Xbox Series S or Series X.</p><p>If you’re looking for a bit more space, we’ve created a list of the best Xbox external hard drives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024"><a href="#Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024"></a><strong>Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive"><a href="#1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive" class="headerlink" title="1.

With this drive, you get a standard Seagate drive in a flashier case. The (admittedly quite nice) embossed Xbox logo and official green case are an additional $15-20. It’s a great choice if the price is right for you, and aesthetics are a concern. Esthetics are important to me, so I think this is the best choice. As often happens around big retail events, Seagate’s 2TB Game Drive in official Xbox green often drops in price, so though this is a great time to buy, we can expect further savings in the coming months.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01065S79E/" >Check on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Fast and Reliable</li><li>Vast Storage of 2TB</li><li>Compatible with different versions of Xbox.</li><li>It is a value for money hard drive.</li></ul><h4 id="2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive"><a href="#2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive" class="headerlink" title="2.

The metal topside gives it a bit of a shipping container aesthetic even though it’s not listed as an armored or “rugged” hard drive. The hard drive remains cool even after extensive usage and runs quietly without making any noise.</p><p>Although the drive’s write speed is not special at 130 megabytes per second, we found that it matched the console’s internal hard drive, So you can run the games directly from the hard drive without worrying about any lags or delays.</p><p>The best thing about this hard drive is that you can find it with different storage capacities ranging from 1Tb to 5Tb. So, the users have the option to choose suitable storage options according to their needs.</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBlack-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VNTFHD5" >Check On Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features</strong>:</p><ul><li>It is extremely portable</li><li>Always runs quietly and cool</li><li>The 3-year warranty is quite reasonable.</li><li>Price is high but is value for money.</li></ul><h4 id="3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance"><a href="#3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance" class="headerlink" title="3.

With a sleek, glossy design, a simple, elegant design, and a nice blue power-light on top, the Toshiba Canvio Advance is an attractive piece of kit. Works just fine. All the drives on this list match its read and write speeds, and it comes with a two-year warranty. Your Xbox console has a USB port that you can connect to, and proceed as usual…</p><p>Additionally, suppose you want to use it for PCs as well. In that case, it includes password protection and automatic backup of files, both of which make it a better budget pick than our previous budget pick, the Canvio Basics. There is only one real disadvantage to the Advance: it does not come in green, so you cannot match it with your console. Nonetheless, white looks slick next to many Xbox consoles. You cannot beat the price of the 1TB version, which is around $50 &#x2F; £50.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Canvio-Advance-Portable-External/dp/B08JKFY8FH/" >Check On Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Small and Compact In Size</li><li>Available in multiple colors.</li><li>Extremely affordable.</li><li>Standard speed but matches to that of your console.</li></ul><h4 id="4-Seagate-Expansion-8TB"><a href="#4-Seagate-Expansion-8TB" class="headerlink" title="4.

This is the ideal choice for those who use their Xbox Ones often and don’t want to worry about storage in the future. It is more expensive and requires an external power adapter (supplied), but it is a surprising device for its size. Seagate’s Expansion 8TB weighs 2.09 lbs and is considerably lighter than large rival capacity external hard drives, including the WD 8TB My Book drive, which weighs 2.9 lbs and measures 1.9 x 5.5 x 6.7 in.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.in/dp/B01HAPGEIE?tag=georiot-in-default-21&ascsubtag=grd-row-1888675391884567800-20&geniuslink=true" >View on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>A vast amount of storage space</li><li>Excellent value</li><li>It needs to be plugged into the mains due to its size and capacity</li><li>A bit large but the capacity is great.</li></ul><h4 id="5-OWC-Envoy-Pro-EX-SSD"><a href="#5-OWC-Envoy-Pro-EX-SSD" class="headerlink" title="5.

Its high-ish price tag is due to this and the fact that it’s an SSD, but the quality you get is undeniable.</p><p>In terms of technology, this is a wonderful piece of kit: a sleek, stylish, silver wedge-shaped drive with a single LED and one connection port that is very robust and pocket-sized. Despite being small, it feels solid and can survive bumps and drops as long as it is handled with care.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Prime-5-Racer-Simulation-Titles-to-Play"><a href="#Prime-5-Racer-Simulation-Titles-to-Play" class="headerlink" title="Prime 5 Racer Simulation Titles to Play"></a>Prime 5 Racer Simulation Titles to Play</h2><p>If you go back in time, about a decade ago, there was a decline in the acceptance of sim racing games. A number of great development studios were closing, and even mainstream series like Need for Speed struggled to maintain their original popularity.</p><p>If you are a racing fan, then there is good news for you. Things are a lot better today as compared to the past. Several racing titles have been introduced over the years, like Forza Horizon, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, etc. We have seen several open-world racing games getting immense popularity among gamers. The simulation racing genre is more competitive than ever today. In July 2015, EA acquired Codemasters for a staggering $1.2 billion, illustrating how highly racing games have been valued for the last few years.</p><p>This article will present our top picks of the best sim racing games you can play right now. Most of these games are modern because this genre is continuously improving. But, we won’t be skipping those classic titles that are still popular among gamers and as good as modern ones. Our primary focus here will be to cover those games that are easy to find and play on the majority of the hardware. So without wasting any time, let’s get to our main topic.</p><h2 id="THE-BEST-SIM-RACING-GAMES"><a href="#THE-BEST-SIM-RACING-GAMES" class="headerlink" title="THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES"></a>THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Dirt-Rally-2-0"><a href="#1-Dirt-Rally-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.Dirt Rally 2.0"></a>1.Dirt Rally 2.0</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dirt-rally-poster.jpg"                      alt="dirt-rally-poster"                ></p><p>If you are looking for the best off-road racing simulation gamers, then dirt rally 2.0 stands on the top of the list. There has probably never been anything better. Despite its unbalanced package, this car offers outstanding handling and a driving experience as gripping as anything else in this class. The best way to experience it is with a good wheel, but it’s unbeatable for communicating the pure thrill of a car and the challenge of a course.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>In terms of career mode, both rallycross and rally mode is available.</li><li>You can play Freeplay to compete for titles, create your own custom game, and run-time trials across all tracks.</li><li>In addition to joining the team, players can increase the ability of team members.</li><li>Overall it offers a great gameplay experience which is worth all the effort.</li></ul><h3 id="2-iRacing"><a href="#2-iRacing" class="headerlink" title="2.iRacing"></a>2.iRacing</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iracing-poster.jpg"                      alt="iracing-poster"                ></p><p>The eSports industry is well known for three things: its costs, time commitment, and toughness. In addition to that, it encapsulates some of the most exciting aspects of motorsport. As you work your way through the ranks, you will experience the same camaraderie and excitement as the real deal - and, yes, crushing disappointment too. It’s undeniable that some aspects of Iracing are becoming a bit stale - and there are certainly more realistic-looking sims out there - but with ten years of experience comes a level of competency you won’t find anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The technology and features it offers are superior to those of its competitors.</li><li>The tracks are very authentic, realistic, and accurate.</li><li>A huge selection of cars is available. Players can find their dream cars in this game.</li><li>The sim racing experience that it offers is unmatchable to any other game.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Assetto-Corsa-Assetto-Corsa-Competizione"><a href="#3-Assetto-Corsa-Assetto-Corsa-Competizione" class="headerlink" title="3.Assetto Corsa &#x2F; Assetto Corsa Competizione"></a>3.Assetto Corsa &#x2F; Assetto Corsa Competizione</h3><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assetto-corse-competizione-poster.jpg"                      alt="assetto-corse-competizione-poster"                ></p><p>The two experiences offered by Kunos Simulazioni are so different, yet both so good, that we’ve included them both. Assetto Corsa has seen better days, but it can still be an awesome driving sim with a few mods, and Competizione is getting better as it reaches iRacing as a pure racing sim. As far as GT racing is concerned, it is probably the healthiest and most diverse form of motorsports right now.</p><p>Assetto Corsa also has a number of useful force feedback options that will let you experience driving a car without having to feel it. You are likely to have the most difficulty getting used to a PC when you start. In reality, you’ll need to step it up when it’s time to get real.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The career mode provides a very real experience where you progress as a racer and earn titles and rewards.</li><li>The advanced physics engine makes it the next-generation simulation game.</li><li>Although the car selection is not so wide, if you don’t mind playing with mods, you won’t get bored with this game.</li><li>The best thing about this game is that you can play it using any kind of device like a keyboard, controller, joystick, etc.</li><li>It provides the best hardware compatibility.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Project-Cars-2"><a href="#4-Project-Cars-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Project Cars 2"></a>4.Project Cars 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/project-cars-2-poster.png"                      alt="project-cars-2-poster"                ></p><p>Project Cars 2 is likewise available on modern consoles, so you can also expect polish and presentation, including an offline career mode that is light but solid. Cars and tracks are abundant here, especially if you purchase the season pass along with numerous car packs.</p><p>Physicists have made these improvements to accommodate the physics engine, like in Assetto Corsa. Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them. The wide range of vehicles here, from two-stroke karts to four-wheel-drive rally vehicles, makes it all feel the same, which is a problem.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics is much better than the competition.</li><li>Classic and new cars are available.</li><li>Race tracks of even better quality.</li><li>Track and weather conditions that are dynamic.</li><li>The difficulty level can be adjusted very easily.</li><li>The PC version of this game has amazing VR.</li></ul><h3 id="5-rFactor-2"><a href="#5-rFactor-2" class="headerlink" title="5.rFactor 2"></a>5.rFactor 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072200/17885" target="_top" id="2072200"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072200"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072200/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rfactor2-poster.png"                      alt="rfactor2-poster"                ></p><p>We go way, way back with rFactor. Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then.

In addition to that, it encapsulates some of the most exciting aspects of motorsport. As you work your way through the ranks, you will experience the same camaraderie and excitement as the real deal - and, yes, crushing disappointment too. It’s undeniable that some aspects of Iracing are becoming a bit stale - and there are certainly more realistic-looking sims out there - but with ten years of experience comes a level of competency you won’t find anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The technology and features it offers are superior to those of its competitors.</li><li>The tracks are very authentic, realistic, and accurate.</li><li>A huge selection of cars is available.

Assetto Corsa has seen better days, but it can still be an awesome driving sim with a few mods, and Competizione is getting better as it reaches iRacing as a pure racing sim. As far as GT racing is concerned, it is probably the healthiest and most diverse form of motorsports right now.</p><p>Assetto Corsa also has a number of useful force feedback options that will let you experience driving a car without having to feel it. You are likely to have the most difficulty getting used to a PC when you start. In reality, you’ll need to step it up when it’s time to get real.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The career mode provides a very real experience where you progress as a racer and earn titles and rewards.</li><li>The advanced physics engine makes it the next-generation simulation game.</li><li>Although the car selection is not so wide, if you don’t mind playing with mods, you won’t get bored with this game.</li><li>The best thing about this game is that you can play it using any kind of device like a keyboard, controller, joystick, etc.</li><li>It provides the best hardware compatibility.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Project-Cars-2-3"><a href="#4-Project-Cars-2-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Project Cars 2"></a>4.Project Cars 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/project-cars-2-poster.png"                      alt="project-cars-2-poster"                ></p><p>Project Cars 2 is likewise available on modern consoles, so you can also expect polish and presentation, including an offline career mode that is light but solid. Cars and tracks are abundant here, especially if you purchase the season pass along with numerous car packs.</p><p>Physicists have made these improvements to accommodate the physics engine, like in Assetto Corsa. Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them. The wide range of vehicles here, from two-stroke karts to four-wheel-drive rally vehicles, makes it all feel the same, which is a problem.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics is much better than the competition.</li><li>Classic and new cars are available.</li><li>Race tracks of even better quality.</li><li>Track and weather conditions that are dynamic.</li><li>The difficulty level can be adjusted very easily.</li><li>The PC version of this game has amazing VR.</li></ul><h3 id="5-rFactor-2-3"><a href="#5-rFactor-2-3" class="headerlink" title="5.rFactor 2"></a>5.rFactor 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892107/21290" target="_top" id="1892107"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892107"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892107/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rfactor2-poster.png"                      alt="rfactor2-poster"                ></p><p>We go way, way back with rFactor. Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.</p><p>RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I’ve listed so far. The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling. It all comes down to user choice and preferences. If you are new to the sim racing environment, you can try all these titles and then decide which one suits you the best.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a

The Adobe Connect’s video editor also enables you to control the volume level by clicking on the audio icon on the right side of the editor’s toolbar.</p><p>If you make a mistake during the video editing process, you can use the Undo button to correct it. When you remove all the unwanted parts of the video, click on the Save button to conclude the video editing session.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Adobe Connect is one of the best software products for the creation of eLearning content and video presentations currently available on the market. Its recording and video editing features are powerful enough to enable the software’s users to capture high-quality footage of web conferences and online training, but Adobe Connect lacks advanced features high-end professionals use to create their content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

It is frequently used as a baseline for the soundtrack of an entire video since it can help the software remove the unwanted noises from the video’s original audio file. Room tone recordings become even more important if you already know that you’ll have to deal with background noises during the video editing process.</p><p>Besides the room tone recording, you will also need some audio editing software, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>if you want to remove or at least reduce the levels of audio noise.

Removing background audio noises after recording with a software program like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a better option since it enables you to edit audio and video files in the same project.</p><p>Import the video file into Filmora video editor and place the file on the timeline. Select the audio file and head over to the Audio menu on the left side of the screen. Make sure that the Enable checkbox, in the Denoise menu is marked and then proceed to select Weak, Mid or Strong value. You can play the video and hear if the background noises have been removed. If the audio track has too much noise, you can use the Mute option or you can detach the audio file from the video file and delete it. That’s how easy it is to remove background noises with Wondershare Filmora.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Regardless of the type of video you are creating, having crystal clear audio is equally important as producing sharp, high-resolution videos. Video clips that have a great soundtrack are more likely to be a success on social media, which is why you should do everything in your power to create videos that don’t contain any of the unpleasant noises you might have accidentally captured during a screen recording session.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

If Zoom is configured to accept sounds from system audio, the mic sends the signals back to the speakers that again send the audio output to the mic. Since this iteration never ends, you continuously hear an audio feedback loop.</p><h5 id="How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?"></a>How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>In order to eliminate this issue, make sure to place both microphone and speakers at a safe distance from each other. This would prevent the microphone from receiving any output from the speakers, and the chain of audio feedback loop would never take place.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-1"><a href="#What-Is-It-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Background noise is the distortion or humming that you hear during an audio call on zoom.</p><h5 id="Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?"></a>Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>If you have a highly sensitive microphone that is mostly used by professionals or in recording studios, the chances are that it will catch a lot of background noise during a Zoom meeting.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?</h5><p>This issue can be resolved by either hosting or joining a meeting in a closed, soundproof room, or using a less sensitive mic. It would be best if you use a normal headset that is easily available in any local electronic shop. You can also try enabling the <strong>Automatically adjust volume</strong> option from the <strong>Microphone</strong> section of the <strong>Audio</strong> category of the <strong>Settings</strong> box as explained earlier in <strong>Step 3</strong> of the <strong>Zoom Audio Settings When Not in Meeting</strong> section.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-2"><a href="#What-Is-It-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p><strong>Zoom audio echo</strong> is when you hear an echo sound during an ongoing Zoom meeting with audio enabled.</p><h5 id="How-It-Happens-1"><a href="#How-It-Happens-1" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>Echo happens when you are on a laptop and are using onboard speakers and microphone, and that too with the speaker or mic volume set to maximum.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?</h5><p>As mentioned earlier, it is always advisable to use a headset to avoid any such unwanted echo or audio feedback loop issues. In case you don’t have access to a headset, try configuring the microphone settings to automatically adjust the volume, and not putting the speaker volume to the max.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Configuring <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong> before hosting or joining a meeting is always a wise approach to avoid any audio inconsistencies during an ongoing conference. However, if you are already in one, you can use the methods given above to configure the microphone settings to get the audio right. You are also encouraged to use an average quality headset during a Zoom meeting to avoid any <strong>Zoom audio echo</strong>, feedback loop, or background noises.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"

We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record at 4K resolution and edit your video to make it more interesting and eye-catching.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"

It is true that these games are not very graphically intense and can’t compete for the AAA titles, but it won’t be fair to compare them with those heavy and graphics-intensive games. Played repeatedly, these games continue to keep players interested even after they are released for years. But who cares that much if you’re just looking for some good rogue game to play.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-roguelike-game-What-is-a-roguelite-game"><a href="#What-is-a-roguelike-game-What-is-a-roguelite-game" class="headerlink" title="What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?"></a>What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?</h2><p>Gamers have been debating whether roguelikes are different from roguelites for years. If you study them in general, you will find that both roguelikes and roguelites are the RPGs subgenres. In general, roguelikes and roguelites place more emphasis on death than other kinds of video games do.</p><p>You might have a question in your mind that what is a <strong>roguelike game</strong>? It is a convoluted category of games, but it had a clear beginning. It all started with an early dungeon crawling game, “Rogue” in 1980. At that time, computers were very limited in their speed and memory capabilities.</p><p>You have to give credit to the computer programmers because instead of taking the low memory capacity of computers as a limitation at that time, they developed a game and introduced the concept of “procedural generation to save the memory space.” If you have ever played a game that has randomly generated level systems and each time gives you a unique experience, then you have already tried a roguelike game or a roguelite game.</p><p>In roguelikes, players’ progress is usually lost if they die, while in roguelites, rewards or progression are usually saved between runs. This is the main difference between roguelikes and roguelites. Although there are many other differences, let’s focus on discussing the best roguelike games and roguelite games present today.</p><p><strong>Want a more detailed explanation?

So, let’s get started without wasting any time.</p><hr><h2 id="1-Darkest-Dungeon"><a href="#1-Darkest-Dungeon" class="headerlink" title="1.Darkest Dungeon"></a><strong>1.<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/262060/Darkest%5FDungeon/" >Darkest Dungeon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platform:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 24.99.</em></p><p>In Darkest Dungeon, your misery is manifest all around you. The oppressive visuals, brutal difficulty, and extreme bleakness make the game feel so oppressive in the extreme. With its dungeons and scavenger hunts, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, looking for treasure and gold.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/darkest-dungeon.png"                      alt="darkest-dungeon"                ></p><p>It’s one thing to defeat each dungeon’s horrifying inhabitants in turn-based combat, but your party members should also be more than meat shields. Your expeditions will inevitably take a toll on your body and mind, and this is the main reason that makes Darkest Dungeon so challenging.</p><p>Your tactical instincts will be put to the test when it comes to teamwork and resource allocation. This is undoubtedly one of the best roguelikes to be found.</p><h2 id="2-Downwell"><a href="#2-Downwell" class="headerlink" title="2.Downwell"></a><strong>2.<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/Downwell/" >Downwell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC, iOS, Android</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 2.99.</em></p><p>Only a couple of minutes to complete each run, this roguelike takes us on an adventure on the inside. As you dive deeper into an endless well filled with dangerous creatures, you are only protected by a pair of deadly gumboots that kill enemies, slowing down your fall for a moment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/downwell.png"                      alt="downwell"                ></p><p>Don’t let its retro look fool you. This 2015 title is fast and intense, with a good amount of power-ups that boost your survivability. It is immediately enjoyable with its fast-paced downward action, but gaining mastery of its combat is no simple feat. Downwell is one of the best roguelikes out there, despite its intense difficulty. Its concise levels, satisfying combo system, and creative boss are among the roguelikes’ best features.</p><h2 id="3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup"><a href="#3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup" class="headerlink" title="3.

While quick decision-making and foresight are required in the genre, the escalating rhythm forces players to maintain a higher tempo to maintain a strong combo, and all you know is, you can’t lose the combo.

You need to buy additional characters, though. They differ in cost, and some are $1.99 while others can be upwards of $2.99. It’s not expensive for me, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily ideal.</p><p>The Otherworld Legends game is incredibly entertaining to play with beautiful graphics, and enjoyable setting, and a cast of interesting characters. If you’re looking for entertaining games to pass the time, the Otherworld Legends games are an excellent choice.</p><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> you wanna record your gameplay and upload to YouTube?

How to Record Video with Streamlabs"></a>2. How to Record Video with Streamlabs</h2><p>It’s good to know that Streamlabs has a few choices to play with if you’re using a graphics card encoder. Try Recording if you don’t require a lot of quality, and if it doesn’t enough, you can always move up to High-Quality Recording. Consider the size of the files before using Indistinguishable or Near-Lossless Recording if you require high-quality recordings. Many of the other settings on the Recording panel have to do with bitrate when you go to Advanced. As part of your recording setup, this is essentially the greater the bitrate, the bigger the file size of the video. To avoid pixelated video, it is best to keep the bitrate at a reasonable level. So beginning with the Streamlabs OBS download for pc, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide for you.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Install-and-Launch-Streamlabs-OBS"><a href="#Step-1-Install-and-Launch-Streamlabs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install and Launch Streamlabs OBS"></a>Step 1: Install and Launch Streamlabs OBS</h2><p>The method of installation is really simple.

The next step is to enter your stream key so that Streamlabs OBS may upload your material to the platform for viewing by other subscribers. Click Settings &gt; Stream &gt; and then input your stream key to do this. In the lower right-hand corner, click “Go Live” to begin streaming. If you’re encoding with x264, you’ll have to enter these values by hand. The best bitrate depends on your screen size and set-up, so there isn’t a universal setting that works for everyone. When recording at 60 frames per second in 1080p, you can start with 40,000kbps and adjust as needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-or-share.jpg"                      alt="save or share"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Computer-Screen"><a href="#3-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Computer-Screen" class="headerlink" title="3.

The Streamlabs OBS helps you keep track of your donations and fans. With pre-made themes and templates, it is also easier to incorporate them in a live stream. Non-Streamlabs versions of OBS still support OBS templates, themes, and overlays. But due to its lacking of various features, there’s an alternative to it namely Wondershare Filmora. Both streaming and real-time recording are possible with Filmora screen recorder, which produces HD video quality and is easy to use. Thus, the study explains how to record YouTube videos and how to view them online.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Step-1-Get-the-Software"><a href="#Step-1-Get-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Get the Software"></a>Step 1: Get the Software</h2><p>As an option, you can record the screen in high-definition (HD). The first step in setting up Wondershare Filmora is to download it from the company’s website and then run the setup file that is downloaded. Once it has been installed, you can run it from your computer. To begin recording, you must click the “Record Mode” menu after the software has been launched. As a result, a new screen will be displayed. In this section, you’ll need to select the area of your computer that you want to record. You can change the recording area’s size by dragging the dotted red color bar, or you can manually enter the screen’s dimensions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-mode.jpg"                      alt="record mode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=11224199&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/copy_boxshot_lyricvideo.png"                      border="0"                >Lyric Video Creator Professional Version</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode"><a href="#Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode"></a>Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode</h2><p>A camera attached to your computer will automatically be detected and begin recording your activities as soon as you finish the installation. If you want to record part of the screen to use in your tutorial, you can do so in a variety of ways, including by selecting a specific area of the screen to record. Both webcam and screen captures are supported by Filmora. If you prefer, you can take advantage of an external camera. This feature is bolstered by the ability to select your preferred video recording resolution while you are filming.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enter-the-recording-mode.jpg"                      alt="enter the recording mode"                ></p><p>It’s like when recording video, by default, the system’s audio is recorded, but this can be disabled.

As a result, a new screen will be displayed. In this section, you’ll need to select the area of your computer that you want to record. You can change the recording area’s size by dragging the dotted red color bar, or you can manually enter the screen’s dimensions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-mode.jpg"                      alt="record mode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode-3"><a href="#Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode"></a>Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode</h2><p>A camera attached to your computer will automatically be detected and begin recording your activities as soon as you finish the installation.

It’s extremely simple to utilize with numerous social media sites such as YouTube, Facebook Live, and Twitch. Today, we will teach you how to link OBS Studio with Facebook Live and start broadcasting in no time. You may embed scene sources inside scene sources so that the user can control what’s occurring. Using this will enable you to represent a certain scenario throughout a historical period. Nesting sceneries enable you to edit one portion of a scene without having to go through the full scenario. OBS Studio takes your web camera, microphone, and other devices as inputs and works well on all Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. It has a big community, which assures a steady supply of filters, transition effects, overlays, and help if you ever have trouble when working the program.</p><p>On Facebook Live, it’s very simple to generate high-quality live streaming nowadays, but effective live broadcasts take a little know-how and technical knowledge or understanding. OBS Studio allows you to communicate with your Facebook network via HD live streaming. It allows you to make your live broadcasts seem professional and leave a lasting impression. Open Broadcaster Software Studio is a free live streaming application with cross-platform interoperability. It gives you extensive customization choices, enabling you to manage every element of video recording and streaming. In addition to video recording and streaming, OBS can also allow you to capture your computer screen and live stream gameplays in high quality. The program provides a customizable UI to match your needs simply. Many of the OBS features match those seen in paid products. Here, we’ve put together our best advice for maximizing OBS settings for live broadcasting.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Audio-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Audio-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Audio Recorder"></a>Filmora Audio Recorder</h5><p>Record computer system audio</p><p>Capture microphone audio</p><p>Customize recording volume</p><p>Record screen and webcam as well</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Set up OBS Stream Settings"></a>Part 1: How to Set up OBS Stream Settings</h2><p>OBS Studio provides several wonderful tools for beginner broadcasters who are just getting the swing of live broadcasting. The program contains a set of OBS-specific system requirements to guarantee the most optimum live broadcasting experience. These options include the ability to mix several sources with unique transitions, employ audio&#x2F;video filters and correction tools, and more. First, access the OBS Studio settings by selecting the “Settings” button in the bottom-right region of the program window. The first tab, named “General,” doesn’t include anything particularly significant to examine. However, here, you may pick your language and choose a bright or dark theme.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings"><a href="#Steps-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Set up OBS Stream Settings"></a>Steps to Set up OBS Stream Settings</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Once you’ve evaluated these options, click on the next tab labeled “Stream” in the OBS Studio settings box. Game capture is suggested for live streaming since it is designed for recording screen material as well as capturing video. Multiple sources may be utilized as scenes, and they can be made visible or invisible with the touch of a button.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-obs-stream-settings.jpg"                      alt="set up obs stream settings"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> As soon as you run OBS, you are greeted with the auto-config window, which automatically picks various choices for you based on how you want to use it. The auto-configuration settings may be toggled again by clicking on Tools -&gt; Auto-Configuration Wizard. However, your connection speed may be too slow to handle this bitrate.

We may add as many sources as we need. There are several choices for visual sources as well as audio channels. By default, the resolution is the same as the laptop screen.

Chill, you don’t need a professional studio for this purpose. There is a lot of software, but zoom podcast recording is relatively more straightforward. A podcast is a collection of audio files that you can either download or listen to online using the internet. This article will help you learn to record podcasts using zoom.</p><h2 id="7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom"><a href="#7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?"></a>7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?</h2><p>Recording a podcast on zoom is quite simple and easy. You don’t need to be a recording expert; you can get it done at home using your laptop. In this article, I will guide you on how to record a podcast using zoom step by step.</p><h5 id="Step1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#Step1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download and Install"></a>Step1 Download and Install</h5><p>The 1st step is downloading and installing zoom on your device. Next, create your zoom account by visiting the <a class="link"   href="https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/?url=https://zoom.us&id=5&geo=&ub=https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/&gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966AtsDXlasyuqO9r1vrbTzSdxKyOMLNsfNLa_RFZ12PRcu09P4sKnMcaAlUHEALw_wcB" >zoom website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Log in to this account with your installed software and enjoy zoom free. The free version allows you to record for 40 minutes. For longer calls, purchase the paid version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-1.jpg"                      alt="download and install zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones"><a href="#Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones"></a>Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones</h5><p>Zoom can use your device’s built-in microphone, but it is advised to use a high-quality external mic. It enhances the quality of your podcast tremendously. Plenty of external mics are available for under 50$, which can make a real difference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-2.jpg"                      alt="set up microphone and headphones"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise"><a href="#Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise"></a>Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise</h5><p>No one is interested in listening to what’s happening in the background while listening to your podcast. So, before pressing the ‘Record’ button, ensure your environment is as quiet as possible. You can take the following steps to reduce background noises.</p><ul><li>Turn off the fan, air conditioner, or any other noisy appliances.</li><li>Remove noisy kids, roommates, or pets.</li><li>Hang a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on your front door.</li><li>Shut your door and windows to avoid noise from outside sources, such as sirens, traffic horns, etc.</li><li>Avoid the rustling sound of paper or moving things around your desk.</li><li>Install noise-canceling software to filter out any background noise.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-3.jpg"                      alt="eliminate background noise"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker"><a href="#Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker"></a>Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker</h5><p>Wouldn’t it be easier to edit your podcast if you recorded audio tracks for each speaker separately? Zoom has this feature of recording separate audio tracks.</p><p>To enable this, go to your zoom ‘Settings’ and click on the ‘Recording’ setting. Then select “Record a separate audio file for each participant,” and you are ready to go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-4.jpg"                      alt="separate audio tracks for each speaker"                ></p><h5 id="Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin"><a href="#Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin"></a>Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin</h5><p>If you are going live and your guest is new to zoom, it is better that you guide him briefly about the functioning of zoom. Guide your guest on how to join the call using zoom. It would be best if you also told him about the duration and topic of your podcast.</p><p>It is advised to test the microphone and headphones of your guest before starting a live podcast.

Unlike other media players, QuickTime Player is not just for playing audio and video files. The application can record the screen on Mac and save the recordings on the hard drive. Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they <strong>cannot stop QuickTime screen recording</strong> following the standard procedure.</p><p>When the application fails to stop recording, it fails to save the recording as well. Therefore, QuickTime Player keeps recording the screen, and this slows down the Mac as it keeps occupying the system resources. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to QuickTime Player stop screen recording. We will also recommend a better alternative to QuickTime for professional-quality screen recording.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record computer screen and webcam</p><p>Capture system and microphone audio</p><p>Customize the target recording area</p><p>Edit videos with thousands of effects and tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="1-Direct-Way-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording"><a href="#1-Direct-Way-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording" class="headerlink" title="1.

It is a professional screen recording and video editing software available for both Mac and Windows users.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-creating-immersive-experiences-with-quality-video-voice-over/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Creating Immersive Experiences with Quality Video Voice Over</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-capturing-your-gaming-adventures-best-practices-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Capturing Your Gaming Adventures  Best Practices Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-capture-discord-talks-best-ways-to-record-live-streaming-sessions-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Capture Discord Talks  Best Ways to Record Live Streaming Sessions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-screen-savers-strategy-top-recording-tactics/"><u>[Updated] The Screen Saver's Strategy  Top Recording Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-unboxing-high-fidelity-gaming-recorders/"><u>[Updated] Unboxing High-Fidelity Gaming Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/10-popular-discord-themes-from-betterdiscord-for-2024/"><u>10 Popular Discord Themes [From BetterDiscord] for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-5-tunefab-screen-recording-tips-and-tricks/"><u>2024 Approved  Top 5 Tunefab Screen Recording Tips & Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultra-hd-playback-best-ps5-and-hdmi-21-compatible-monitors/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultra HD Playback  Best PS5 & HDMI 2.1 Compatible Monitors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-vidma-screen-capture-a-thorough-examination-and-alternative-options/"><u>2024 Approved  Vidma Screen Capture - A Thorough Examination & Alternative Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/2024-approved-get-moving-10-best-free-video-speed-controller-apps-for-iphone-and-android/"><u>2024 Approved Get Moving 10 Best Free Video Speed Controller Apps for iPhone and Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/3-easy-solutions-to-hard-reset-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>3 Easy Solutions to Hard Reset Samsung Galaxy A15 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-realme-gt-5-pro-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Realme GT 5 Pro?

A layer can be described as any type of image, moving or still, that is superimposed over a background image. However, just adding one layer over another will not create a strong visual impact on the spectator, which is why using Blending Modes is recommended if you want to <strong>blend two overlaying videos or images</strong> seamlessly.</p><p>It is a widely accepted opinion that Blend Modes can only be used in Adobe Premiere Pro or After Effects, but in this article, we are going to bust that myth and show you how to utilize Blending Modes in Filmora Scrn. Before we get started, let’s figure out what blending modes is.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="What-are-Blending-Modes-in-Filmora"><a href="#What-are-Blending-Modes-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="What are Blending Modes in Filmora?"></a>What are Blending Modes in Filmora?</h2><p>Combining videos or images into a single frame is an art that is much older than digital pictures, so when trying to understand Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn it is best to try to visualize two pieces of celluloid film, one over another. Two pieces of film are transparent, but the images they contain do not mix with each other, that is why when you are using Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn you are actually merging videos and allowing their pixels to mix.</p><p>Different ways of combining pixels are called modes, and for that reason, the properties of the <strong>Linear Burn mode</strong> are not the same as the properties of the <strong>Multiply blending mode</strong>. Each mode you select, brings preset image transparency as well as brightness, contrast and color values. Which mode you will use depends mostly on the context and the images you want to use in your video.</p><p>The <strong>Normal mode</strong> is a part of the standard set of blending modes in almost all photo and video editing programs. It enables you to keep the top layer intact, by preventing the pixels from two images to merge. It is a perfect PIP blending mode since it allows you to keep two overlaying images separate and have two different narratives within the same shot. Producers of YouTube videos and tutorials of any kind or gamers who want to entertain their audiences should use the Normal mode when editing their footage captured with Filmora Scrn.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-normal-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>The <strong>Screen Mode</strong> is best used when you are working with dark monochrome backgrounds because it reduces the dark areas in the video thus enabling you to blend the top layer into the background seamlessly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-screen-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>Utilizing this mode successfully requires previous preparation because the effects you’ll get if you use the Screen mode with a footage that is not best suited for this mode are far from impressive. Therefore, the video clips you want to overlay and blend with each other must be recorded perfectly in order to get the best results.</p><p>The <strong>Multiply Mode</strong> is also one of the frequently used blending modes that <strong>multiplies the numbers for each pixel of the overlaying video clip</strong> with a matching pixel from the background video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-multiply-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>This mode will enable you to create the black background for your video effortlessly, and highlight the subjects in the video clip you intend to use as a top layer. You need to choose carefully which video clips you are going to use and how are they going to look on a dark background if you want to produce visually pleasing videos that captivate the viewer’s attention.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Blending-Modes"><a href="#How-to-use-Blending-Modes" class="headerlink" title="How to use Blending Modes?"></a>How to use Blending Modes?</h2><p>Applying different blending modes and switching between them is easy, and it won’t take more than a few minutes of your time, once you get a hold of it.
