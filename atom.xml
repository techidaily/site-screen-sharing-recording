No, it wasn’t the most powerful headset out there, using a two-year-old smartphone processor to power its games and experiences, but it was a capable, completely self-contained, wireless VR headset that didn’t require a PC or game console to deliver stellar immersion.</p><p> It was one of last year’s greatest new gadgets, and now Oculus has returned with a sequel. The Oculus Quest 2 is smaller and lighter, yet more powerful and with a much better screen—yet it costs $100 less than the original. How did that happen? Well, it’s not all great news, thanks to a couple of cost-cutting measures that you’ll feel and potentially see, but the end result is ultimately a better and more affordable device that serves as an ideal gateway into VR.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort: Compromises were made"></a>Design and Comfort: Compromises were made</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 sticks to the familiar modern VR playbook as a module that you strap onto your face to immerse yourself within its digital worlds but features some different material and construction choices than the original. Unfortunately, the design choices largely are not upgrades compared to the original headset</p><p> Noticeably, the module itself doesn’t jut out as far from your face as before, plus it has a white plastic finish rather than the black fabric-lined exterior of the original. It also weighs less, which is a good thing for a device that hangs off of your face: it comes in at 503g compared to 571g with the original Quest.</p><p> However, the shallower depth of the module makes an impact for someone like me who must wear glasses while using the Quest 2.</p><p> Even with the included, optional glasses spacer, which adds a couple extra millimeters between the lenses and where the padded visor presses against your face, the inside felt much tighter against my glasses. It can be tricky to get the Quest 2 on without my eyelashes brushing against my lenses.</p><p> But that’s also due in part to the new fabric strap system, which is less effective than the rubber, dome-like strap from the first Quest. That previous strap did a better job of cupping the back of your head to offset the weight of the module itself and keep it comfortably strapped to your head, but these loose, adjustable fabric straps aren’t nearly as secure. It took me longer to get the headset on and in a comfortable position, and I couldn’t find the same kind of sweet spot as before.</p><p> Oculus now sells a $49 Elite Strap attachment that’s more akin to the original Quest strap, and while the Quest 2 straps are usable, I’ll probably make the upgrade and buy the better strap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JkgQv_Sk0ofSL0Sp-jKmqe84xak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-2-a7792535288542dba45c8bc32f882be2.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Rift 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks"><a href="#Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks"></a>Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 uses the same kind of “inside-out” tracking system that relies on four cameras on the visor to track the wireless controllers or even your hands, rather than relying on external tracking sensors as some PC-based systems do. Like the original, it works amazingly well, allowing for fluid, six-degrees-of-freedom movement in games and minimizing both initial setup and the time it takes to get going each session. It also means that you can use the Oculus Quest 2_anywhere_ without the need for any kind of external hardware or accessories.</p><p> The Quest 2’s wireless, motion-sensing Oculus Touch controllers are identical in function to the original, but are a little heavier and have a larger surface with space to rest your thumb when not in use. That’s handy. Each has an analog stick and two face buttons, along with a trigger button and a grip button. Oculus also swapped out the magnetically-attached battery doors from the first Quest controllers—which would sometimes slide open when I used the original—for ones that simply click into place. That’s a win for function over form.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1aG6kdNHMuvnim8p8_i1RwH9QG8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-3-eec6cabc11db4ed9be5254aa2bc46ec1.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 "                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> But there is a potential loss for function and comfort with one other particular aspect of the headset itself: IPD adjustment. Inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is the physical distance between your eyes, and a headset must account for it to effectively deliver clear, 3D experiences. On the original Quest, a physical slider let you precisely adjust the distance to match your own face. With the Quest 2, however, there are just three settings, and you can physically shift the placement of the lenses to choose the position that is closest to your own.</p><p> If your IPD matches or is very close to one of the settings (58mm, 63mm, 68mm), then you’re all set. If not, then you may notice that the image isn’t as clear as you’d like, and it could potentially lead to headaches if you can’t find a pretty good sweet spot. In my case, my IPD is close enough to the middle setting to be OK, but it doesn’t feel as spot-on as it did on the original Quest using the slider. It might help knock down the price of the headset, but that’s a quality-of-life downgrade that will affect some people significantly more than others.</p><p> That might sound like a lot of griping, but it’s only because some of the key physical design changes on the Quest 2 feel like compromises or downgrades. But for most people, they won’t be significant impediments. And if you’re coming to the new headset without ever using the original Quest, then you should be fine—the new straps are usable, but they aren’t as effective or effortlessly adjustable as before. Luckily, the Quest 2 makes significant strides elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gwWuuSfTzWNDoS45b-iG9qG32-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-4-27f169e7e71b4372a38e13332b7b1364.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook"></a>Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook</h2><p> You should charge the Oculus Quest 2 out of the box, as the modest total battery life means a partially-charged headset isn’t going to last very long. You will need a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , either Android or iPhone, and the free Oculus app to complete setup, as well. Once the headset has a good charge, begin setup from the mobile app and then follow the guided directions, which will involve putting on, adjusting, and getting familiar with the headset itself.</p><p> Part of the setup process, and the process each time you use the headset, is to designate your play space by “drawing” a barrier within the augmented view of your surroundings seen through the headset’s cameras. From there, the headset determines whether you have enough space for active, room-scale experiences, or you can choose a stationary setup for seated play modes. During active play, a virtual barrier called the Oculus Guardian appears when you get close to the edges of your designated play space to help you avoid crashing into your surroundings. It’s all rather clever and effective.</p><p> There’s one other potential hitch with the Oculus Quest 2 that wasn’t present with the original: the new headset_requires_ a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tutorial-how-facebook-works-2654610" >Facebook account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and there’s no way around it. Facebook owns Oculus, and while the first Quest could be used simply with an Oculus account, the new one requires the social media account. For some, that may be a deal-breaker, given frustrations over privacy and the increasing role that Facebook plays in our society, so just know that going in.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4712430&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c404a5adbf90e09631678b13b05d9d7a/products/dlnow_256.png"                      border="0"                >DLNow Video Downloader</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade"><a href="#Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It’s a big upgrade"></a>Performance: It’s a big upgrade</h2><p> The original Oculus Quest did a fine job of delivering immersive VR experiences that didn’t feel compromised or significantly downgraded, even if it didn’t hit the same visual peaks as pricier, PC-powered headsets. And it was pretty amazing that the Quest did so with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, a chip found in 2017’s flagship smartphones.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 takes things to another level, and there are a few reasons why.</p><p> First off, the new Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip here is based on the current Snapdragon 865 chip seen in phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Note20, and is three generations newer than the old chip.</p><p> It’s also paired with 50 percent more RAM (6GB) than the original Quest. Even more vividly, the fast-switching LCD screen packs in nearly 50 percent more pixels per eye than the old OLED panels did, for a noticeably crisper and smoother experience.</p><p> On the first Quest, you got 1440x1600 resolution per eye: solid, but a bit fuzzy and comparatively lower resolution than some of the PC headsets on the market. Here, however, the single screen provides 1832x1920 per eye, and the difference is obvious. While the switch from OLED to LCD technology should weaken the contrast a bit and dampen the deep black levels, I’ll be honest: I didn’t notice.</p><p> What I did notice was sharper interfaces and smoother action, with more fluid-feeling experiences that exhibited fewer of the occasional-yet-tolerable hitches seen with some games and apps on the first Quest headset.</p><p> Additionally, Oculus recently enabled the Quest 2 to hit a peak 90Hz screen refresh rate, up from 72Hz on the first headset, which will only help deliver that smoother-feeling usage. Developers must enable 90Hz within their apps and games, however.</p><p> I felt the Quest 2’s enhancements more prominently in some games over others. Laser sword-swinging music game Beat Saber, for example, ran well on the first headset and isn’t that different here—just smoother and clearer-looking. But with the online battle royale shooter Population: One, the cleaner-looking textures and more fluid performance helped mitigate some of the light motion sickness I felt playing on the first Quest.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones"></a>Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones</h2><p> Plugging in headphones delivers a more closed-off, immersive experience, but the Oculus Quest 2’s built-in speaker does a solid job of delivering audio and music. It does sound a tiny bit louder and fuller than the original Quest’s speaker, but not significantly so. Still, if you want to play without being fully shut-off from your surroundings, it works just fine.</p><h2 id="Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours"><a href="#Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours" class="headerlink" title="Battery: You’ll get a couple hours"></a>Battery: You’ll get a couple hours</h2><p> Like the original headset, the Oculus Quest 2 is rated for 2-3 hours of usage on a full charge. For such a compact, standalone headset, I think that’s reasonable. You get a couple hours to play, and then you can take a breather and do other things while it charges.</p><p> That said, if you’re keen on longer-lasting experiences, Oculus sells a $129 version of the Elite Strap with a built-in battery pack that doubles the play time, or you can get a portable battery pack, plug it in, and stick it in your pocket during use. Lastly, you could just use a lengthy USB-C cable and plug yourself into a wall. If you’re doing room-scale VR games and apps with free movement, however, you’ll need something longer—like 10 feet or more. Otherwise, some seated apps and games will work just fine when you’re tethered to a nearby wall outlet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ns2S3DQVema5UEDDSO8n3N7SC_4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-7-0a0e40b6a3064fe7abc985f0900dbeff.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC"><a href="#Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC" class="headerlink" title="Software: Use the headset or connect to PC"></a>Software: Use the headset or connect to PC</h2><p> The headset’s own interface hasn’t changed much from the first Quest, taking place in a 3D home-like environment with floating menus that you can access via the motion controllers. It’s a pretty easy way to choose between your currently installed games and apps, install anything else in your library, purchase and download new content, and access video content including apps like Netflix, YouTube, and SlingTV.</p><p> Oculus has also enabled optional hand tracking, including the use of hand and finger gestures to get around the interface and interact with some games. Hand tracking is definitely more finicky than using the controllers, however, and you’ll need solid lighting to really rely on it. That said, it does still feel experimental, and I encountered enough misread gestures and incorrect interactions to make me want to stick to the controllers. They work reliably great.</p><p> Since the original Quest’s launch, Oculus added the ability to connect the headset to a powerful PC to run more advanced VR experiences, and that carries over to the Quest 2, as well. You’ll need a PC that is capable of running headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as either the official Oculus Link USB-C cable ($80) or a comparable USB 3.1 cable that can handle the high-speed demands. I bought an unofficial cable for half the price on Amazon, and it worked great.</p><p> Using a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, I was able to play the visually demanding and deeply immersive Half-Life: Alyx on the Oculus Quest 2—a game that it could never run using its own internal hardware. It ran a little less smoothly than it did using the PC-native Valve Index headset, but not significantly so. This is a great way to experience higher-end VR games, including the new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/star-wars-squadrons-review-5086656" >Star Wars: Squadrons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example. And with Oculus announcing plans to phase out PC-only headsets, it will also be a key part of the Quest platform’s future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/72vxixVr7kdKoLfUC3QkIrBl26I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-6-12fcb6054cf2475191bc613a3f26bcfc.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The $299 edition of the headset comes with 64GB of internal storage and the $399 version nets you 256GB, with some of each tally taken up by system software and resources. Luckily, the games and apps themselves aren’t huge, typically weighing in between 1-4GB apiece, sometimes less, and they’re pretty quick to download again if you want to revisit something. The 64GB edition should provide enough space for most players, as you could probably comfortably have a dozen or more games installed, along with streaming media apps, but anyone who wants to have a robust VR library on hand at all times without waiting might consider spending the extra cash.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Games-A-good-growing-selection"><a href="#Games-A-good-growing-selection" class="headerlink" title="Games: A good, growing selection"></a>Games: A good, growing selection</h2><p> Although those aforementioned games and some others are still only found on PC (or maybe PlayStation VR on the PlayStation 4 or 5), the Oculus Quest platform has amassed a very nice selection of native games that you can download and play right on the headset.There is no difference in compatibility between the headsets: all Quest games play on Quest 2 and vice versa, just with performance differences.</p><p> Many of the early games from the impressive Quest launch lineup are still among the best games you can play on the Quest 2. The aforementioned Beat Saber, which finds you swinging your controllers to slash faux lightsabers through soaring rhythmic beats, is a frenetic blast, now with a larger library of songs including BTS and Linkin Park packs. Superhot VR is a stylish hybrid of a shooter and a puzzle game, of sorts, as you figure out how to clear through foes while avoiding incoming bullets that only move when you do. Meanwhile, the Star Wars VR game Vader Immortal still does a great job of creating an authentic atmosphere.</p><p> But there’s so much more now, too. Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite, both from developer Enhance Games, are trippy, trancelike experiences that you can sit down and really savor in VR. Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners and the aforementioned Population: One show that larger-scale shooter experiences can be immersive and compelling in VR, plus there’s a newer Star Wars game, Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, that blends interactive storytelling with fun blaster battles.</p><p> There’s a lot of great stuff on Quest 2, ranging from simple arcade-like experiences to larger-scale adventures, quirky interactive experiences, and more. And on top of that, there are the aforementioned video services for 360-degree videos, plus fitness apps and games, VR chat for communicating with friends and random people, a web browser, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FqVvo044zoPghSD_PR1g2e0L2rs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-5-216bbf638cbe407b8b6f332abc94ae47.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-an-amazing-value"><a href="#Price-It’s-an-amazing-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s an amazing value"></a>Price: It’s an amazing value</h2><p> The Oculus Quest was already impressively priced at $399, so launching the more powerful Oculus Quest 2 at $299 is pretty phenomenal. Granted, the design compromises are a little frustrating, and I would’ve rather paid more for a better strap and more precise IPD settings like on the original—but those are the tweaks made to try and broaden the market for the Quest and VR as a whole. Still, even with those design annoyances, the Quest 2 is an incredible value for a portable, fully self-contained VR game console.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TDsFPvRGkhZaFzIaNnKRk1_xO4s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-8-Comparison-1b0c51b029da41389167e103a4c4843a.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR"></a>Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR</h2><p> Amazingly, there is no direct analog to the Oculus Quest 2 on the market: Oculus seems to be the only company that can release such a powerful device at this kind of price and with this kind of software support. That said, if I had to compare it to another VR headset, I’d put it up against Sony’s PlayStation VR, which requires a PlayStation 4 or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> console.</p><p> The PSVR is a few years old now and is technically overshadowed by the Quest 2 in terms of screen and controller quality. Still, Sony has amassed some stellar exclusive games thanks to its partnerships with game developers, and the PlayStation VR is a solid, reasonably affordable pickup for anyone who already has a PS4 or PS5 console and wants to dabble in VR. But if you don’t already have the console, and you want to get into VR, go for the dedicated Quest 2 instead. It’ll be cheaper than buying a headset and console together, plus it’s a better VR experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-vr-review-4692684" >Sony PlayStation VR Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best VR device, all things considered.</strong></p><p> The significant performance upgrade and surprising price drop outweigh some of the annoying design shifts with the Oculus Quest 2, making it the must-have VR headset for just about everyone. Not only does it play a great library of on-headset games, but it can also connect to a powerful PC to play even more games on top of that. Add to that the ease of use, quality gameplay, and immersive visuals, and the Oculus Quest 2 is another brilliant VR game console.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4699091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/1_jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh Plus -  Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Elite-Driving-Sims-Best-Five-Titles"><a href="#Elite-Driving-Sims-Best-Five-Titles" class="headerlink" title="Elite Driving Sims: Best Five Titles"></a>Elite Driving Sims: Best Five Titles</h2><p>If you go back in time, about a decade ago, there was a decline in the acceptance of sim racing games. A number of great development studios were closing, and even mainstream series like Need for Speed struggled to maintain their original popularity.</p><p>If you are a racing fan, then there is good news for you. Things are a lot better today as compared to the past. Several racing titles have been introduced over the years, like Forza Horizon, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, etc. We have seen several open-world racing games getting immense popularity among gamers. The simulation racing genre is more competitive than ever today. In July 2015, EA acquired Codemasters for a staggering $1.2 billion, illustrating how highly racing games have been valued for the last few years.</p><p>This article will present our top picks of the best sim racing games you can play right now. Most of these games are modern because this genre is continuously improving. But, we won’t be skipping those classic titles that are still popular among gamers and as good as modern ones. Our primary focus here will be to cover those games that are easy to find and play on the majority of the hardware. So without wasting any time, let’s get to our main topic.</p><h2 id="THE-BEST-SIM-RACING-GAMES"><a href="#THE-BEST-SIM-RACING-GAMES" class="headerlink" title="THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES"></a>THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES</h2><h3 id="1-Dirt-Rally-2-0"><a href="#1-Dirt-Rally-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.Dirt Rally 2.0"></a>1.Dirt Rally 2.0</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dirt-rally-poster.jpg"                      alt="dirt-rally-poster"                ></p><p>If you are looking for the best off-road racing simulation gamers, then dirt rally 2.0 stands on the top of the list. There has probably never been anything better. Despite its unbalanced package, this car offers outstanding handling and a driving experience as gripping as anything else in this class. The best way to experience it is with a good wheel, but it’s unbeatable for communicating the pure thrill of a car and the challenge of a course.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>In terms of career mode, both rallycross and rally mode is available.</li><li>You can play Freeplay to compete for titles, create your own custom game, and run-time trials across all tracks.</li><li>In addition to joining the team, players can increase the ability of team members.</li><li>Overall it offers a great gameplay experience which is worth all the effort.</li></ul><h3 id="2-iRacing"><a href="#2-iRacing" class="headerlink" title="2.iRacing"></a>2.iRacing</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iracing-poster.jpg"                      alt="iracing-poster"                ></p><p>The eSports industry is well known for three things: its costs, time commitment, and toughness. In addition to that, it encapsulates some of the most exciting aspects of motorsport. As you work your way through the ranks, you will experience the same camaraderie and excitement as the real deal - and, yes, crushing disappointment too. It’s undeniable that some aspects of Iracing are becoming a bit stale - and there are certainly more realistic-looking sims out there - but with ten years of experience comes a level of competency you won’t find anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The technology and features it offers are superior to those of its competitors.</li><li>The tracks are very authentic, realistic, and accurate.</li><li>A huge selection of cars is available. Players can find their dream cars in this game.</li><li>The sim racing experience that it offers is unmatchable to any other game.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Assetto-Corsa-Assetto-Corsa-Competizione"><a href="#3-Assetto-Corsa-Assetto-Corsa-Competizione" class="headerlink" title="3.Assetto Corsa &#x2F; Assetto Corsa Competizione"></a>3.Assetto Corsa &#x2F; Assetto Corsa Competizione</h3><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assetto-corse-competizione-poster.jpg"                      alt="assetto-corse-competizione-poster"                ></p><p>The two experiences offered by Kunos Simulazioni are so different, yet both so good, that we’ve included them both. Assetto Corsa has seen better days, but it can still be an awesome driving sim with a few mods, and Competizione is getting better as it reaches iRacing as a pure racing sim. As far as GT racing is concerned, it is probably the healthiest and most diverse form of motorsports right now.</p><p>Assetto Corsa also has a number of useful force feedback options that will let you experience driving a car without having to feel it. You are likely to have the most difficulty getting used to a PC when you start. In reality, you’ll need to step it up when it’s time to get real.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The career mode provides a very real experience where you progress as a racer and earn titles and rewards.</li><li>The advanced physics engine makes it the next-generation simulation game.</li><li>Although the car selection is not so wide, if you don’t mind playing with mods, you won’t get bored with this game.</li><li>The best thing about this game is that you can play it using any kind of device like a keyboard, controller, joystick, etc.</li><li>It provides the best hardware compatibility.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Project-Cars-2"><a href="#4-Project-Cars-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Project Cars 2"></a>4.Project Cars 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/project-cars-2-poster.png"                      alt="project-cars-2-poster"                ></p><p>Project Cars 2 is likewise available on modern consoles, so you can also expect polish and presentation, including an offline career mode that is light but solid. Cars and tracks are abundant here, especially if you purchase the season pass along with numerous car packs.</p><p>Physicists have made these improvements to accommodate the physics engine, like in Assetto Corsa. Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them. The wide range of vehicles here, from two-stroke karts to four-wheel-drive rally vehicles, makes it all feel the same, which is a problem.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics is much better than the competition.</li><li>Classic and new cars are available.</li><li>Race tracks of even better quality.</li><li>Track and weather conditions that are dynamic.</li><li>The difficulty level can be adjusted very easily.</li><li>The PC version of this game has amazing VR.</li></ul><h3 id="5-rFactor-2"><a href="#5-rFactor-2" class="headerlink" title="5.rFactor 2"></a>5.rFactor 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rfactor2-poster.png"                      alt="rfactor2-poster"                ></p><p>We go way, way back with rFactor. Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.</p><p>RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I’ve listed so far. The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling. It all comes down to user choice and preferences. If you are new to the sim racing environment, you can try all these titles and then decide which one suits you the best.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>If you are looking for the best off-road racing simulation gamers, then dirt rally 2.0 stands on the top of the list.

In reality, you’ll need to step it up when it’s time to get real.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The career mode provides a very real experience where you progress as a racer and earn titles and rewards.</li><li>The advanced physics engine makes it the next-generation simulation game.</li><li>Although the car selection is not so wide, if you don’t mind playing with mods, you won’t get bored with this game.</li><li>The best thing about this game is that you can play it using any kind of device like a keyboard, controller, joystick, etc.</li><li>It provides the best hardware compatibility.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Project-Cars-2-3"><a href="#4-Project-Cars-2-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Project Cars 2"></a>4.Project Cars 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/project-cars-2-poster.png"                      alt="project-cars-2-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Project Cars 2 is likewise available on modern consoles, so you can also expect polish and presentation, including an offline career mode that is light but solid.

Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them.

Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.</p><p>RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I’ve listed so far. The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling. It all comes down to user choice and preferences. If you are new to the sim racing environment, you can try all these titles and then decide which one suits you the best.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a

Most WhatsApp users use calling feature for personal communication. However, even corporates use WhatsApp to talk to team members and have a quick discussion. One of the common questions we come across from WhatsApp users “Can WhatsApp call be recorded?”</p><p>However, there is no default call recording option available. Therefore, you will need an external <strong>WhatsApp call recording app</strong> if you want to record your call on your Phone.

You should visit whatsapp.com&#x2F;download from the web browser of your computer and download and install WhatsApp for Desktop. Connect your WhatsApp account, and you can receive WhatsApp call from your WhatsApp contact anytime you want.</p><p>WhatsApp for Desktop or WhatsApp for Web has limited features. You cannot make calls, but you can receive calls. If you want all the features on your computer, you have to install WhatsApp through simulators like BlueStacks. If you want to record WhatsApp call on your computer, you need a WhatsApp call recorder. We recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to record anything on the screen with audio including WhatsApp video calls.

WhatsApp has literally replaced text messaging and its free audio call feature is widely used as an alternative to traditional call. At the same time, users prefer WhatsApp video call over audio call for personal communication with contacts. Due to its usage more for personal communication over professional communication, there is no WhatsApp record feature available for security and privacy reason.</p><p>That is why you will need an external screen recorder app and we recommend AZ Screen Recorder. The app is free to use and very easy to operate. With a single tap, you can record anything on the screen including WhatsApp call. Here are the steps to follow to record WhatsApp call on Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store from your Android device and install AZ Screen Recorder app.</p><p>Step 2: Launch AZ Screen Recorder and the app will provide you with a pop-up overlay bar on the screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open WhatsApp and go to the conversation of the person whom you want to video call.</p><p>Step 4: On AZ Screen Recorder bar, tap on Record icon.

How to Record a WhatsApp Call on Android?"></a>Part 2. How to Record a WhatsApp Call on Android?</h2><p>WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app among Android users. WhatsApp has literally replaced text messaging and its free audio call feature is widely used as an alternative to traditional call. At the same time, users prefer WhatsApp video call over audio call for personal communication with contacts. Due to its usage more for personal communication over professional communication, there is no WhatsApp record feature available for security and privacy reason.</p><p>That is why you will need an external screen recorder app and we recommend AZ Screen Recorder. The app is free to use and very easy to operate. With a single tap, you can record anything on the screen including WhatsApp call. Here are the steps to follow to record WhatsApp call on Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store from your Android device and install AZ Screen Recorder app.</p><p>Step 2: Launch AZ Screen Recorder and the app will provide you with a pop-up overlay bar on the screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open WhatsApp and go to the conversation of the person whom you want to video call.</p><p>Step 4: On AZ Screen Recorder bar, tap on Record icon. You will get 3 seconds of buffer time to start your WhatsApp video call. Thereafter, the app will start recording the screen which is your WhatsApp video call in this case.</p><p>Step 5: When you have finished your video call, tap on Stop icon on AZ Screen Recorder bar. The recorded video file will be available in the phone gallery.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Record-WhatsApp-Video-Call-on-iPhone-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Record-WhatsApp-Video-Call-on-iPhone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you can use the default screen recorder feature available to record WhatsApp call. However, if your iPhone has iOS lower than 11, you can either update iOS to 11 or use a WhatsApp video call recorder. Otherwise, you can connect your iPhone to Mac, and you can use QuickTime Player to record WhatsApp video call.</p><p>Using iOS Inbuilt Screen Recorder -</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings&gt; Control Centre.</p><p>Step 2: Turn on Screen Recording option.</p><p>Step 3: Open WhatsApp and prepare for the video call.</p><p>Step 4: Open Control Centre on your iPhone.</p><p>Step 5: Tap on Screen Recording icon and thereafter, start WhatsApp video call to record.</p><p>Use QuickTime Player on Mac -</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-new-movie-recording.jpg"                      alt="quicktime audio recorder"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac through lightning cable.</p><p>Step 2: Launch QuickTime Player and go to File&gt; New Audio Recording option.</p><p>Step 3: Choose iPhone as the microphone source and click on Record button.</p><p>Step 4: On your iPhone, make WhatsApp call with your chosen person, and QuickTime will be recording the conversation.</p><p>Step 5: Once the call is over, you need to stop the recording and go to File&gt; Save to save the recorded file on your computer.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder-3"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder-3" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a>Filmora Screen Recorder</h5><p>Record computer screen and webcam</p><p>Capture system and microphone audio</p><p>Customize the target recording area</p><p>Edit videos with thousands of effects and tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Hopefully, you have understood how to record WhatsApp video call on your device.

Google Meet integrates Jamboard, an online tool that enables you to brainstorm ideas during the virtual meet-up. The meeting host can easily activate Jamboard after starting a meeting. This makes <strong>Google Meet Whiteboarding</strong> easily accessible for all participants during the live session. In this way, students can collaborate with instructors or other students very clearly. Moreover, the whiteboard feature also allows them to answer questions and review notes.

Thus, it is recommended to use third-party tools for using the whiteboard feature. In this case, you have to share your screen in the Google Meet session and then navigate to the third-party app having a built-in whiteboard. However, the participants will not be able to make any changes on the whiteboard, and they can only watch the visuals of your screen. Are you an iPhone user and want to use whiteboard apps? If yes, the following step-by-step guide will help you.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Microsoft whiteboard app</strong></p><p>Navigate the Microsoft app in the app store and click install.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Join Google meeting room and share screen</strong></p><p>Click three dots at the bottom and select share screen. Press the <strong>start sharing</strong> button to confirm the action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Use whiteboard in the Microsoft app</strong></p><p>Go to your home page and launch the Microsoft Whiteboard.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since you will be sharing the screen of your iPhone, participants will be able to see your whiteboard activity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an Android Device"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an Android Device</strong></h2><p>Similar to iPhone, you cannot use the in-built Jamboard Google Meet tool on Android devices. Even if you try accessing Google Meet from the browser on your android phone, you are likely to be redirected to Google Meet, where there is no whiteboard option. So, the only way out is to download an external whiteboard app from Playstore and use its whiteboard. Your whiteboard activity will be visible to other participants in a Google Meet session when you share the screen. However, this option is only viable if you are the only one illustrating on the whiteboard and no other participants are required to perform any whiteboard activity. If this works for you, follow the step-by-step guide below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Whiteboard application</strong></p><p><strong>Find the Whiteboard app on the Google Playstore and click install</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Join Meeting and Share screen</strong></p><p><strong>Click new meeting and press dots at the bottom of your screen. Select the screen sharing option and confirm it.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 3: Access the Whiteboard app</strong></p><p><strong>Navigate to your home page and launch the whiteboard app. What you draw on the whiteboard will be visible to the meeting attendees.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-whiteboard-mobile.jpg"                      alt="create Google Meet whiteboard on mobile"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Save-and-Send-Jams-as-PDFs"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Save-and-Send-Jams-as-PDFs" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Save and Send Jams as PDFs?"></a><strong>Bonus: How to Save and Send Jams as PDFs?</strong></h2><p>Once you end up in a meeting, the Jamboard activity can be shared in a PDF file.

The maximum utility of this feature is when you use it on your desktop or laptop. This gives all attendees whiteboard editing access. However, for mobile phone users, editing access is only for using an external whiteboard app. This article covered all dimensions, including setting up, using, and sharing whiteboards on Google Meet.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play.

Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button.

Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps. With the help of a ROM flasher, you can get a screen recorded included in your devices ROM. Therefore, if you already have a custom ROM running on your device, better to have a look if a screen recorder is installed. If so, it is a matter of activating it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

However, a quick online search will come up with several links that explain how to use third-party applications in conjunction to get motion effects as a virtual background in the app. This is a workaround for now, and not a permanent solution.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="FPS-Game-Quest-–-Discovering-7-Ultimate-Titles"><a href="#FPS-Game-Quest-–-Discovering-7-Ultimate-Titles" class="headerlink" title="FPS Game Quest – Discovering 7 Ultimate Titles"></a>FPS Game Quest – Discovering 7 Ultimate Titles</h2><p>The greatest first-person shooter games take place in warzones all over the globe and in various historical eras let’s hop into the blog to know about Best Fps Games. They can look stunning, particularly on the PS5 and Xbox Series X, and they can overwhelm with interesting new twists on the tried-and-true shooter concept. They often put us against brainy villains and those who wish to devour them. And they never fail to wow with their speed and flair.</p><p>While talking about Best Fps Games’ first-person shooters are one of the most popular game genres, picking the top 30 examples is difficult. We need a set of laws, but even then, another ten are killed by a headshot for every gunman who makes it through. On this list, we’ll look at games with first-person shooting as their main mechanic. In 2021, the game should be playable right now. Multiplayer FPS and first-person battle royales are hot, while first-person action RPGs like Fallout 4 and action-adventure games like Deathloop are out and known as best Fps games. These are the guidelines. Shooting the messenger isn’t a good idea.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the 7 best Fps games available right now.</p><h3 id="1-BLACK-MESA"><a href="#1-BLACK-MESA" class="headerlink" title="1.BLACK MESA"></a>1.BLACK MESA</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/black-mesa-poster.jpg"                      alt="black-mesa-poster"                ></p><p>Black Mesa is just a fan-made Half-Life 1 remake that runs on the latest Source engine. Black Mesa took 15 years to achieve version 1.0, but it’s well worth waiting when it was released in 2020. To offer a more condensed experience, the remake is a revised version of the classic single-player campaign, with no outdated puzzles or battle sequences. The crew also created an enhanced version of Alien planet Xen, ostensibly cut from Half-Life 1’s last chapter.</p><p>Although there’s no denying the Half-Life 1 is just a great game, particularly in light of what it achieved for PC gaming, its gameplay isn’t without flaws, which are addressed in Black Mesa. Black Mesa is the greatest way to see what you’ve been losing out on if you haven’t experienced the original Half-Life game. Black MESA is included in this list of the greatest FPS games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Recreation of Half-Life.</p><p>• More concise experience.</p><h3 id="2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS"><a href="#2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS" class="headerlink" title="2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS"></a>2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops.jpg"                      alt="call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops"                ></p><p>Following the success of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reboot and Warzone, Black Ops – Cold War needed to live up to Infinity Ward’s expectations. Fortunately, Cold War stands up to the hype, and the result is a game that is both snappy and fast-paced, two key characteristics of a successful Call of Duty game so cold war black ops make their place in the best Fps games.</p><p>Cold War embraces the absurdity of its alternative history premise, enabling the developers to include characters like John McClane and Rambo in the mix. There are various endings in the campaign, including one in which Russia wins the Cold War. The multiplayer mode, updated every two months with fresh material, has to be the game’s highlight. This isn’t limited to multiplayer maps; entirely new modes, such as the large-scale Zombies Outbreak mode, have been introduced to the game.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Snappy and fast-paced.</p><p>• Multiplayer mode.</p><p>• Large-scale Zombies Outbreak mode.</p><h3 id="3-OVERWATCH"><a href="#3-OVERWATCH" class="headerlink" title="3.OVERWATCH"></a>3.OVERWATCH</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/overwatch.jpg"                      alt="overwatch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://cowinaudio.pxf.io/c/5597632/1116855/13794" target="_top" id="1116855"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13794-1116855"                      border="0" alt="" width="767" height="285"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1116855/13794"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you want to compare it to Team Fortress 2 or League of Legends, go ahead.

These honors are also well-deserved. Half-Life 2 is a tremendously ambitious game that benefits from being created by a much more confident valve.</p><p>Everything is larger this time around than in 1998: the settings, the adversaries, the narrative - it’s a blockbuster but a smart one. There are excellent AI partners; genuine people that exist to do more than die hilariously; and mechanics that make the environment feel real and substantial.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Tremendously ambitious game.</p><p>• The blockbuster environment feels.</p><h3 id="6-Escape-from-TARKOV"><a href="#6-Escape-from-TARKOV" class="headerlink" title="6.Escape from TARKOV"></a>6.Escape from TARKOV</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/escape-from-tarkov.jpg"                      alt="escape-from-tarkov"                ></p><p>There are a lot of FPS games that claim to be realistic, but none compare to Escape from Tarkov’s dev team’s fanatical attention to detail when it comes to weapons, attachments, and ballistics modeling. Not only are there over 60 weapons in Escape from Tarkov, but each one may be modified or stripped down to the point of being unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents. For each ammunition type, you may change barrels, mounts, scopes, flashlights, foregrips, pistol grips, handguards, muzzle attachments, stocks, charging handles, magazines, receivers, and gas blocks as well as select from a variety of cartridge kinds. These reasons are enough for this game to make a place in the best Fps games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Realistic modeling.</p><p>• Unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents.</p><h3 id="7-TITANFALL-2"><a href="#7-TITANFALL-2" class="headerlink" title="7.TITANFALL 2"></a>7.TITANFALL 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/titanfall-2.jpg"                      alt="titanfall-2"                ></p><p>EA and Respawn improved on what the original game did well, and the multiplayer in this shooter sequel was so perfectly balanced that it became one of the best Fps games of 2016. Titanfall 2’s mix of gritty, industrial mech brawling and agile pilot combat is unparalleled. The solo mode of Titanfall 2 also offers a great introduction to the game’s mechanics and a fascinating, self-contained story, as you’ll discover in our Titanfall 2 campaign review.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Perfectly balanced.</p><p>• Self-contained story.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Black Mesa is just a fan-made Half-Life 1 remake that runs on the latest Source engine.

The crew also created an enhanced version of Alien planet Xen, ostensibly cut from Half-Life 1’s last chapter.</p><p>Although there’s no denying the Half-Life 1 is just a great game, particularly in light of what it achieved for PC gaming, its gameplay isn’t without flaws, which are addressed in Black Mesa.

Black Mesa took 15 years to achieve version 1.0, but it’s well worth waiting when it was released in 2020. To offer a more condensed experience, the remake is a revised version of the classic single-player campaign, with no outdated puzzles or battle sequences. The crew also created an enhanced version of Alien planet Xen, ostensibly cut from Half-Life 1’s last chapter.</p><p>Although there’s no denying the Half-Life 1 is just a great game, particularly in light of what it achieved for PC gaming, its gameplay isn’t without flaws, which are addressed in Black Mesa. Black Mesa is the greatest way to see what you’ve been losing out on if you haven’t experienced the original Half-Life game. Black MESA is included in this list of the greatest FPS games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Recreation of Half-Life.</p><p>• More concise experience.</p><h3 id="2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS-3"><a href="#2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS-3" class="headerlink" title="2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS"></a>2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops.jpg"                      alt="call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops"                ></p><p>Following the success of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reboot and Warzone, Black Ops – Cold War needed to live up to Infinity Ward’s expectations. Fortunately, Cold War stands up to the hype, and the result is a game that is both snappy and fast-paced, two key characteristics of a successful Call of Duty game so cold war black ops make their place in the best Fps games.</p><p>Cold War embraces the absurdity of its alternative history premise, enabling the developers to include characters like John McClane and Rambo in the mix. There are various endings in the campaign, including one in which Russia wins the Cold War. The multiplayer mode, updated every two months with fresh material, has to be the game’s highlight. This isn’t limited to multiplayer maps; entirely new modes, such as the large-scale Zombies Outbreak mode, have been introduced to the game.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Snappy and fast-paced.</p><p>• Multiplayer mode.</p><p>• Large-scale Zombies Outbreak mode.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729320&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/2_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-OVERWATCH-2"><a href="#3-OVERWATCH-2" class="headerlink" title="3.OVERWATCH"></a>3.OVERWATCH</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/overwatch.jpg"                      alt="overwatch"                ></p><p>If you want to compare it to Team Fortress 2 or League of Legends, go ahead.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

For that, you need to connect your iPhone to your Mac and while you make the FaceTime call on your iPhone, it will be recorded through Mac. We will be using QuickTime Player on Mac to record your FaceTime call on iPhone. Here are the steps to follow rigorously.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac through Lightning cable.</p><p>Step 2: Open QuickTime on your Mac and go to File&gt; New Movie Recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-new-movie-recording.jpg"                      alt="new movie recording"                ></p><p>Step 3: Click on Arrow icon beside Record button and under Camera section, select your iPhone.

However, it’ll be much better if you can share that fantastic experience with the rest of the globe, right? In the end, game recording software may let you do just that. It doesn’t matter whether you’re playing Minecraft or a shooting game; being able to share your knowledge with a large group of people is always impressive. Furthermore, the cycle has become much easier for players as a result of the accelerating innovation. You may record a full-screen continuing interaction at 60 frames per second with Gecata by Movavi and save it as an MP4 movie with recommended configurations for YouTube transmission.</p><p>Gecata is a good and maybe the best option for Windows users looking for a lightweight but very functional game recording program. It also ensures a single tick, which is a slack-free action that enables you to broadcast and record at the same time. Individual hotkeys are included, allowing you to explore your game without being interrupted. It also allows you to capture videos in 4K at 120 frames per second, which is rather impressive for a gadget of this sort. Add sound from speakers and a mouthpiece to your interaction accounts, as well as webcam video, so you can share your emotions with viewers when you upload the video to YouTube or another video-sharing platform.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Gecata-Recorder’s-Highlights"><a href="#Part-1-Gecata-Recorder’s-Highlights" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Gecata Recorder’s Highlights"></a>Part 1: Gecata Recorder’s Highlights</h2><p>The Gecata game recorder comes with a free trial version, after which you can purchase the complete version for a reasonable price. The stage’s UI makes it simple to remove the unwanted content from the streams.</p><p><strong>Obtain Sound and Microphone for the Game:</strong></p><p>This Movavi game capture program allows for two-way solid capture of in-game audio files, music, and speech, as well as mouthpiece yield. You may comment on the activity as you go using Gecata by Movavi. Save sound streams as individual sound documents so you may remove bloopers without destroying the movie.</p><p><strong>Speed of Transfer:</strong></p><p>Make your videos more easily available on YouTube in HD by saving them in MP4 with the recommended parameters. Upload your video evidence on YouTube. Gecata by Movavi has improved the catch design by using YouTube suggestions, allowing you to manage your HD recordings in minutes.</p><p><strong>Following the Production:</strong></p><p>Save game footage, webcam video, and sound analysis as separate documents so you may remove bloopers without ruining your playthroughs. When you’re finished, you’ll have the choice of viewing the video in MP4, a format supported by most devices and recommended for transmission by YouTube.</p><p><strong>Sources of Information:</strong></p><p>You may use Gecata from Movavi to overlay webcam video over the game footage. Choose the size and location of the webcam window, or save it as a separate video track for further customization. Use these to quickly create expressions and statements.</p><p><strong>Screenshots to Capture:</strong></p><p>Many players like transferring screenshots of their current engagement to provide a basic notion about the video’s content and the genuine qualities of the game being played. The customer may take screen screenshots while the video is being recorded using this product.</p><p><strong>Execution:</strong></p><p>Before uploading the video to any stage, the product allows you to easily edit, convert, and adjust the file size, bit rate, outlining rate, and other characteristics of the video. The device may record and encode video up to multiple times faster when used in conjunction with NVIDIA NVENC and Intel HD Graphics equipment performance increases.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Gecata-to-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Gecata-to-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Gecata to Record Games"></a>Part 2: How to Use Gecata to Record Games</h2><p>Movavi Gecata is a relatively new continuing interaction recording program that costs just $19.95 and has all of the features that gamers want. PC games are more well-known than they have ever been, and players are eager to document their interactions. Some people have to transmit to their friends, while some do it professionally as Twitch or YouTube decorations. Regardless of the intended use, make sure you think about Gecata in light of the surrounding reality of interest.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download and install Gecata by Movavi</strong></p><p>After the download is complete, launch the.exe file and follow the Installation Wizard’s instructions. It will just take a few seconds to finish the interaction. When it’s finished, open the program and capture whatever gameplay footage you need.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Modify the Capture Options</strong></p><p>Make sure the Capture mode in the main window is set to Game. The noises of the framework will be picked up on their own. If you need to capture your voice and face while you’re playing, enable the Microphone and Webcam on the Devices page.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Take a video of the game</strong></p><p>If you need to start recording after dispatching the game, click Start Recording in the application interface before starting the game; otherwise, start the game you want to record. To start or stop recording, use F10, and to stop, press F9. You don’t need to do anything; the game film will be stored on your hard disk as an MP4 file as a result. This is how to record games on a computer, and it couldn’t be much easier!</p><p><strong>Step 4: Save your Gameplay</strong></p><p>Change the Video quality slider to choose the output video quality.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Budget-Conscious-OBS-Tweaks-and-Tricks"><a href="#Budget-Conscious-OBS-Tweaks-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Budget-Conscious OBS Tweaks and Tricks"></a>Budget-Conscious OBS Tweaks and Tricks</h2><p>In the past two decades, the digital and IT industry is growing at a jet pace. Programmers are inventing more applications to make our life easier. Similarly, the invention of youtube is one of its prevalent examples of all inventions. Billions of people are watching youtube, among them, millions are video streamers. Today Youtubers and other platform streamers are building costly computational machines to stream their videos with high resolutions and frames per second but it’s not the case for everyone like you and I cannot afford to build those high-end PC or Laptops.</p><p>Therefore, after vast research on the internet, our team came up with an optimal solution to show you a way to stream your videos lag-free, jitter-free, and without any blurriness in a costless way possible. We recommend you the best studio software known as OBS for your streaming using the best OBS settings for your low-end PC or a Laptop. These OBS settings will let you record videos for low-end PC or laptops to stream now without any issues. Keeping things in a little hurry let’s straight dive into the real stuff of this article.</p><h2 id="1-Video-Settings"><a href="#1-Video-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Settings"></a>1. Video Settings</h2><p>Since we are concerned about the streaming of video. It is important to know how to set up your videos settings. To set your video settings you need to follow the steps given below.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Go-to-Settings"><a href="#Step-1-Go-to-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Go to Settings"></a>Step 1: Go to Settings</h3><p>First, you will need to launch your OBS software. On the main menu, you have to go to file-&gt; settings. You will see a new window will pop up for settings as shown in the figure below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-video-settings-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs video settings go to settings"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep"><a href="#Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep"></a>Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep</h3><p>Starting with base resolution, it is the video resolution that we are going to send to the people who are going to watch our stream. So for the best one, click on it and choose <strong>1280*720</strong>.</p><p>Output tab, which is the resolution of the video that the people will watch. For fast and lag-free streaming it’s best to keep both the output and base resolution the same to avoid any conversion between the resolution by CPU. So click on output resolution and choose <strong>1280*720</strong> again. If you noticed your computer is still lagging then it’s best to change to 480p but below this, it’s not recommended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-settings-that-you-should-keep.jpg"                      alt="obs settings that you should keep"                ></p><p>After that, it comes to the filter option. There are multiple filter options in this tab but for a fast and better result, you have to choose the <strong>“bilinear”</strong> filter as shown in the figure below. Finally, when it comes to frame per second you gotta be careful here. The more the fps the more it will put load on your CPU means it will become laggy but it is best to keep it <strong>30 fps</strong>, not more than this and not less than this if you are using a low-end PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Output-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Output-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Output Settings"></a>Step 3: Output Settings</h3><p>Once you are done with the general video settings now it’s time you should come to the output settings. For that, you will need to choose the output from the main vertical tab as shown in the figure below in 1. You will see a new window appears with a variety of settings. Now it’s time to choose the advanced setting as shown in 2 in the figure to see all settings to be edited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-settings-edited.jpg"                      alt="obs output settings edited"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Let’s move towards the detail settings for the output video for your audience it’s best to choose the settings shown in the figure and below for lag-free and jitter-free video.</p><p><strong>Encoder:</strong></p><p>The first setting is the encoder setting for your output video. There are two options for it, if you are not using any NVidia graphics card and relying on CPU then it is best to choose x264, which will utilize your CPU.</p><p><strong>Rescale Output:</strong></p><p>The rescale output settings should be kept the same as 720p of the video you are streaming.</p><p><strong>Rate Control:</strong></p><p>Keep the rate control CBR.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong></p><p>Normally, for low-end PCs, you should keep the bitrate to 3000 kbps. However, if you are finding it struggling with your PC in the form of a lag or jitteriness then it’s recommended to drop it low till you get the better results. For the NVIDIA card keep the bitrate to 3000 as it is perfectly fine for it.</p><p><strong>CPU Usage Preset:</strong></p><p>It comes with a lot of options to keep your CPU usage for the video. It is best recommended to keep the CPU usage very fast for good results. If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card then it is best to change the CPU usage to “performance” to get the best out of your machine.</p><p><strong>Profile:</strong></p><p>By default, the profile option is disabled and you should keep these settings as it is if you are not using the NVIDIA card but if it’s not so then it’s recommended to choose the “main” on the profiling option.</p><p>So that’s it for the video settings. These are all the settings that you need to adjust before streaming. After doing it so you just need to click apply button below and bingo it is done.</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Settings"><a href="#2-Audio-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Settings"></a>2. Audio Settings</h2><p>For a clear and better audio performance, it’s also necessary you keep the optimum settings for the audio too. Well, you don’t have to worry now about the audio too. After reading this article you should keep the same audio settings here for your PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Output-Audio"><a href="#Step-1-Output-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Output Audio"></a>Step 1: Output Audio</h3><p>The audio settings can be adjusted from two places. Let us discuss the first one. For that, you will need to select the output in the vertical tab and go to audio as shown in the figure below. You will see multiple tracks in these windows. It contains the audio settings for multiple sources. However, if you are using a single it’s good to choose 320 in track one. For multiple, there is no need to change the audio track but to keep the same 320. These are the perfect settings for most cases of the audio settings for your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-audio-settings-adjust.jpg"                      alt="obs output audio settings adjust"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296685&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2022/video-pp/ScreenshotSlider/Nero-Video-Advanced-editing.JPG"                      border="0"                >Simple and intuitive video editing<br>🎬 Nero Video:<br>The powerful video editing program for your Windows PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713321&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVDJ1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV DJ Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Audio Tab Settings"></a>Step 2: Audio Tab Settings</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-audio-tab-settings-steps.jpg"                      alt="obs audio tab settings steps"                ></p><p>The audio consists of many settings,it is divided into categories lets start one by one and explain it.</p><p><strong>Sample Rate and Channels:</strong></p><p>It is the resolution of the audio. The more the sampling rate the more the bits of the audio you sent which means the more the quality of the audio improves. However, there is no need to keep it high but an optimum value works well too. Therefore, keep it <strong>48khz</strong> for the best result as shown. Another thing is a channel, which contains a lot of options but most of you will want the <strong>“stereo”</strong> since it’s the most common choice from the streamers.</p><p><strong>Desktop Audios:</strong></p><p>The desktop audio depends on the device you are using for the audio. It is best to use the default if you don’t know about your device otherwise choose USB if you are audio uses the USB port. For the second audio source, you can choose desktop audio 2 and set it accordingly.</p><p><strong>Auxiliary Audio:</strong></p><p>The streamers usually have one mic source but if you have multiple mic sources then you choose up to 4 auxiliary audio ports and set the device’s settings.</p><p><strong>Meter: Decay Rate &amp; Peak Meter Type:</strong></p><p>The meter is a decibel meter (dB). It is a measurement of volume. The more the decibels, the more it is loud. So use the decay rate to choose between fast, medium, and slow volumes accordingly to your needs. The Peak Meter type is used for your CPU usage. IF you have set higher CPU usage then go for the “true peak” otherwise chose “sample peak”.</p><p>Finally, the rest of the options should be kept as default since being a streamer you won’t need them to change and they are pretty much basic hotkeys to set up if you wish to.</p><h2 id="3-Stream-Settings"><a href="#3-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="3.
