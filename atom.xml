They can also join it through Gmail. Joining a Meet conference through Gmail is exceptionally easy. All you have to do is follow the steps outlined below.</p><p>First, go over to the Gmail website and log in to your Gmail account. Once you have done that, near the bottom left side of your screen you will see two options; “Start a meeting” and “Join a meeting”. To join a meeting through a conference link or code, click “Join a meeting”.</p><p>Upon clicking the “Join a meeting” button, a popup will appear on the screen asking for the meeting code. Here, enter in the meeting code provided to you and click “Join”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-on-gmail.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  on Gmail"                ></p><p>The user will be redirected to the main joining screen of Google Meet, where they must click “Join” again to enter the conference.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Join-A-Scheduled-Google-Meet-From-a-Google-Calendar-Event"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Join-A-Scheduled-Google-Meet-From-a-Google-Calendar-Event" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Join A Scheduled Google Meet From a Google Calendar Event?"></a>Part 3: How to Join A Scheduled Google Meet From a Google Calendar Event?</h2><p>Google makes use of very centralized processes, all its applications and functions are integrated. Therefore, you can even join a Google Meet Conference from Google Calendar. However, in this case, an event must be scheduled first by the host, and the participant who is looking to join must be a guest in the event. If you match this criterion then head on over to your Google Calendar to join Google Meet conferences.</p><p>Google Calendar automatically opens to the current day, so all your events from that day are visible on your screen, as shown in the image below.</p><p>From those events, click on the event which you would like to join and a popup will appear on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  on calendar"                ></p><p>On the pop-up, users can see a button saying “Join with Google Meet”, click that button and users will automatically be redirected to the main joining page of Google Meet.</p><p>Upon landing on the main joining page, click “Join” and you will become a part of the Meet session you wanted to join.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Join-Google-Meet-Using-Link"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Join-Google-Meet-Using-Link" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Join Google Meet Using Link?"></a>Part 4: How to Join Google Meet Using Link?</h2><p>Did someone invite you to a Google Meet session and send a link instead of the code? Well, you can still join the meeting with a link only as well. The process is very similar to that of joining with a Google Meet code.</p><h3 id="1-Directly-Joining-Through-URL-Bar"><a href="#1-Directly-Joining-Through-URL-Bar" class="headerlink" title="1. Directly Joining Through URL Bar"></a>1. Directly Joining Through URL Bar</h3><p>The quickest and easiest way to join with a link is by directly pasting it in the URL bar on your desktop or laptop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-in-google-meet-with-link-browser.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  with link on browser"                ></p><p>Click enter and you will automatically be redirected to the Google Meet main joining page.</p><p>After being redirected to the joining page, you will have options to mute your microphone or turn off the camera, work with the options according to your needs.

Join A Meeting With A Link Through The Google Meet Website"></a>2. Join A Meeting With A Link Through The Google Meet Website</h3><p>Another way through which individuals can join Google Meet using a link is through the Google Meet website. First, you must open the Google Meet website.</p><p>After opening the website, find the text box which says “Enter a code or link”, paste the link over there and click “Join”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-with-link-website.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  with link on website"                ></p><p>Once that is done, the participant will be redirected to the main joining page of Google Meet from where they can continue to the session.</p><h3 id="3-Join-A-Meeting-With-A-Link-Through-Google-Calendar"><a href="#3-Join-A-Meeting-With-A-Link-Through-Google-Calendar" class="headerlink" title="3. Join A Meeting With A Link Through Google Calendar"></a>3. Join A Meeting With A Link Through Google Calendar</h3><p>If the first two methods just aren’t working out for you, you can also join the session using the Google Calendar. Remember, to use this option, one must have a pre-scheduled meeting in place and they must be invited by the host. If that is the case then you are good to go!</p><p>Make your way over to the Google Calendar website and you will find all your events for a certain day displayed on your screen.</p><p>Click on the event which has been scheduled for the Google Meet session that you would like to join and a popup will appear on your screen like the one attached below.</p><p>On the popup you can see a button which says “Join with Google Meet” and just below that, you can find a link to the Meet session as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-link-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  with link on calendar"                ></p><p>Copy the link from there and paste it into the URL bar.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Frugal-Hardware-Efficient-OBS-Arrangements"><a href="#Frugal-Hardware-Efficient-OBS-Arrangements" class="headerlink" title="Frugal Hardware: Efficient OBS Arrangements"></a>Frugal Hardware: Efficient OBS Arrangements</h2><p>In the past two decades, the digital and IT industry is growing at a jet pace. Programmers are inventing more applications to make our life easier. Similarly, the invention of youtube is one of its prevalent examples of all inventions. Billions of people are watching youtube, among them, millions are video streamers. Today Youtubers and other platform streamers are building costly computational machines to stream their videos with high resolutions and frames per second but it’s not the case for everyone like you and I cannot afford to build those high-end PC or Laptops.</p><p>Therefore, after vast research on the internet, our team came up with an optimal solution to show you a way to stream your videos lag-free, jitter-free, and without any blurriness in a costless way possible. We recommend you the best studio software known as OBS for your streaming using the best OBS settings for your low-end PC or a Laptop. These OBS settings will let you record videos for low-end PC or laptops to stream now without any issues. Keeping things in a little hurry let’s straight dive into the real stuff of this article.</p><h2 id="1-Video-Settings"><a href="#1-Video-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Settings"></a>1. Video Settings</h2><p>Since we are concerned about the streaming of video. It is important to know how to set up your videos settings. To set your video settings you need to follow the steps given below.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Go-to-Settings"><a href="#Step-1-Go-to-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Go to Settings"></a>Step 1: Go to Settings</h3><p>First, you will need to launch your OBS software. On the main menu, you have to go to file-&gt; settings. You will see a new window will pop up for settings as shown in the figure below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-video-settings-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs video settings go to settings"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep"><a href="#Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep"></a>Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep</h3><p>Starting with base resolution, it is the video resolution that we are going to send to the people who are going to watch our stream. So for the best one, click on it and choose <strong>1280*720</strong>.</p><p>Output tab, which is the resolution of the video that the people will watch. For fast and lag-free streaming it’s best to keep both the output and base resolution the same to avoid any conversion between the resolution by CPU. So click on output resolution and choose <strong>1280*720</strong> again. If you noticed your computer is still lagging then it’s best to change to 480p but below this, it’s not recommended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-settings-that-you-should-keep.jpg"                      alt="obs settings that you should keep"                ></p><p>After that, it comes to the filter option. There are multiple filter options in this tab but for a fast and better result, you have to choose the <strong>“bilinear”</strong> filter as shown in the figure below. Finally, when it comes to frame per second you gotta be careful here. The more the fps the more it will put load on your CPU means it will become laggy but it is best to keep it <strong>30 fps</strong>, not more than this and not less than this if you are using a low-end PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Output-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Output-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Output Settings"></a>Step 3: Output Settings</h3><p>Once you are done with the general video settings now it’s time you should come to the output settings. For that, you will need to choose the output from the main vertical tab as shown in the figure below in 1. You will see a new window appears with a variety of settings. Now it’s time to choose the advanced setting as shown in 2 in the figure to see all settings to be edited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-settings-edited.jpg"                      alt="obs output settings edited"                ></p><p>Let’s move towards the detail settings for the output video for your audience it’s best to choose the settings shown in the figure and below for lag-free and jitter-free video.</p><p><strong>Encoder:</strong></p><p>The first setting is the encoder setting for your output video. There are two options for it, if you are not using any NVidia graphics card and relying on CPU then it is best to choose x264, which will utilize your CPU.</p><p><strong>Rescale Output:</strong></p><p>The rescale output settings should be kept the same as 720p of the video you are streaming.</p><p><strong>Rate Control:</strong></p><p>Keep the rate control CBR.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong></p><p>Normally, for low-end PCs, you should keep the bitrate to 3000 kbps. However, if you are finding it struggling with your PC in the form of a lag or jitteriness then it’s recommended to drop it low till you get the better results. For the NVIDIA card keep the bitrate to 3000 as it is perfectly fine for it.</p><p><strong>CPU Usage Preset:</strong></p><p>It comes with a lot of options to keep your CPU usage for the video. It is best recommended to keep the CPU usage very fast for good results. If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card then it is best to change the CPU usage to “performance” to get the best out of your machine.</p><p><strong>Profile:</strong></p><p>By default, the profile option is disabled and you should keep these settings as it is if you are not using the NVIDIA card but if it’s not so then it’s recommended to choose the “main” on the profiling option.</p><p>So that’s it for the video settings. These are all the settings that you need to adjust before streaming. After doing it so you just need to click apply button below and bingo it is done.</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Settings"><a href="#2-Audio-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Settings"></a>2. Audio Settings</h2><p>For a clear and better audio performance, it’s also necessary you keep the optimum settings for the audio too. Well, you don’t have to worry now about the audio too. After reading this article you should keep the same audio settings here for your PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Output-Audio"><a href="#Step-1-Output-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Output Audio"></a>Step 1: Output Audio</h3><p>The audio settings can be adjusted from two places. Let us discuss the first one. For that, you will need to select the output in the vertical tab and go to audio as shown in the figure below. You will see multiple tracks in these windows. It contains the audio settings for multiple sources. However, if you are using a single it’s good to choose 320 in track one. For multiple, there is no need to change the audio track but to keep the same 320. These are the perfect settings for most cases of the audio settings for your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-audio-settings-adjust.jpg"                      alt="obs output audio settings adjust"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Audio Tab Settings"></a>Step 2: Audio Tab Settings</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-audio-tab-settings-steps.jpg"                      alt="obs audio tab settings steps"                ></p><p>The audio consists of many settings,it is divided into categories lets start one by one and explain it.</p><p><strong>Sample Rate and Channels:</strong></p><p>It is the resolution of the audio. The more the sampling rate the more the bits of the audio you sent which means the more the quality of the audio improves. However, there is no need to keep it high but an optimum value works well too. Therefore, keep it <strong>48khz</strong> for the best result as shown. Another thing is a channel, which contains a lot of options but most of you will want the <strong>“stereo”</strong> since it’s the most common choice from the streamers.</p><p><strong>Desktop Audios:</strong></p><p>The desktop audio depends on the device you are using for the audio. It is best to use the default if you don’t know about your device otherwise choose USB if you are audio uses the USB port. For the second audio source, you can choose desktop audio 2 and set it accordingly.</p><p><strong>Auxiliary Audio:</strong></p><p>The streamers usually have one mic source but if you have multiple mic sources then you choose up to 4 auxiliary audio ports and set the device’s settings.</p><p><strong>Meter: Decay Rate &amp; Peak Meter Type:</strong></p><p>The meter is a decibel meter (dB). It is a measurement of volume. The more the decibels, the more it is loud. So use the decay rate to choose between fast, medium, and slow volumes accordingly to your needs. The Peak Meter type is used for your CPU usage. IF you have set higher CPU usage then go for the “true peak” otherwise chose “sample peak”.</p><p>Finally, the rest of the options should be kept as default since being a streamer you won’t need them to change and they are pretty much basic hotkeys to set up if you wish to.</p><h2 id="3-Stream-Settings"><a href="#3-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="3. Stream Settings"></a>3. Stream Settings</h2><p>Here are the streaming settings that you just need to follow for your streaming videos. The streaming tab consists of settings for the platform you are going to stream your video. Let’s begin with step-by-step procedures to follow for the best streaming settings for your low-end PCs or laptops.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Stream-Tab"><a href="#Step-1-Stream-Tab" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Stream Tab"></a>Step 1: Stream Tab</h3><p>The streaming tab can be accessed from the main vertical tab. After going to the main “stream” tab you will see a bunch of options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-stream-settings-tab-service-1.jpg"                      alt="obs stream settings tab service 1"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Streaming-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Streaming-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Streaming Settings"></a>Step 2: Streaming Settings</h3><p><strong>Service:</strong></p><p>Here you have to choose the platform on which you are going to stream your videos. It consists of multiple names of popular streaming servers such as youtube, twitch, Facebook live, etc.</p><p><strong>Server:</strong></p><p>This option let you choose a server to upload your streaming. It is best to keep it on “auto” because it will select the server with the best pings for quality streaming.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative-to-OBS"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative-to-OBS" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="From-the-Grave-to-Gameplay-Top-8-Zombies-Unleashed"><a href="#From-the-Grave-to-Gameplay-Top-8-Zombies-Unleashed" class="headerlink" title="From the Grave to Gameplay: Top 8 Zombies Unleashed"></a>From the Grave to Gameplay: Top 8 Zombies Unleashed</h2><p>Which zombie games are the best for PC? It’s difficult to walk down the street on PC without zombie games grabbing at your leg, so it’s a legitimate concern. Don’t write off the genre because there are a few brainless clones - we’ve compiled a list of some of the zombie games to hit PC.</p><p>There are a lot of zombie enemies in the zombie games, and they enjoy eating brains, and there’s a lot more to them than that. You’ll be forced to put your survival and fighting abilities to the test in a hostile environment, and you’ll discover how humankind can come together in the face of hardship. The zombie games provide a wide range of action-packed adventures that are both complex and entertaining.</p><p>Here are the greatest zombie videogames you can play right now, starting with number 10 and working your way up to our top one pick. Our list of zombie games contains tales with repercussions, resource management, traditional Capcom danger, and more. You’ll be able to discover your new zombie-filled adventure here since it covers a wide range of genres.</p><h3 id="1-Worldwar-Z"><a href="#1-Worldwar-Z" class="headerlink" title="1.Worldwar Z"></a>1.Worldwar Z</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/worldwar-z-poster.jpg"                      alt="worldwar-z-poster"                ></p><p>There isn’t much to World War Z by itself, but there isn’t a better game for mow down dozens, if not hundreds, of zombies with a group of friends or strangers. It’s based in part on the Brad Pitt film from 2013. Nonetheless, it’s mainly an excuse to repeat the film’s one distinguishing attribute: swarms of monsters that rush down streets and crash around curves like a torrent through a breached dam.</p><p>It is undeniably influenced by the Left 4 Dead series (RIP). It does, however, have several modern game mainstays like selectable classes &amp; permanent progression. You may choose to play as a Horror flick, who gets extra health by rapidly killing enemies, a Fixer, who places traps in safe areas, or even one of four additional classes. Whatever character you select to level up first, you’ll get to fire a lot of lead into sliding walls of decaying flesh.</p><h3 id="2-Dying-Light-The-Following"><a href="#2-Dying-Light-The-Following" class="headerlink" title="2.Dying Light: The Following"></a>2.Dying Light: The Following</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dying-light-the-following-poster.jpg"                      alt="dying-light-the-following-poster"                ></p><p>Running over zombies has never been more fun. The Foregoing is really a DLC for Dying Light that eliminates much of the parkour again from the original game and instead places you behind the wheel of a car across a stretch of nearly spotless countryside. Splatter zombies spewing gore and leave tire tracks in their guts as you drive across the fields, attempting daring jumps. Just make sure you don’t get a monster head caught in your wipers.</p><h3 id="3-State-of-the-Decay-2"><a href="#3-State-of-the-Decay-2" class="headerlink" title="3.State of the Decay 2"></a>3.State of the Decay 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/state-of-the-decay-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="state-of-the-decay-2-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike Project Zomboid, which concentrates primarily on the concept of being an ordinary person in an unfair position, the States of Decay series tries to keep you amused with the beautiful midwestern countryside and Gorey entertaining combat even while your supplies run out and zombies smash down your gate.</p><p>The introduction of multiplayer in States of Decay 2 is probably the most intriguing new feature. Inviting people to help protect and hunt for your village greatly expands the scope of procedurally produced tales. It also enables you to put to the test all of those zombie outbreak survival tactics you’ve spent way too much time talking with your pals.</p><h3 id="4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019"><a href="#4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019" class="headerlink" title="4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)"></a>4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resident-evil-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="resident-evil-2-poster"                ></p><p>Resident Evil 2’s sequel treads a thin line between the sluggish horror of the original Resident Evil game and the quicker (but still methodical) action of the post-Resident Evil 7 period. It succeeds in being both a worthy homage to the first Resident Evil 2 and the most important, playable RE games in years as a result of this. The key is the zombies, as you’d expect from a game that ranks among the zombie games. Even while the remake’s mobility and shooting controls seem to be more contemporary and streamlined, each zombie can only take so many shots - even headshot - before resurrecting. Even immediately in front of your eyes, or perhaps a few minutes later, when you believe you are secure.</p><p>In the remake of Resident Evil 2, the perfect aim isn’t enough to ensure your life. The most essential element is caution since you save ammunition by firing to stun rather than kill. You could even decide the zombies can take the passageway while you retain the ammunition. It’s still not as terrifying as the other major Resident Evil remake in terms of sheer dread. However, the Resident Evil 2’s remake is undoubtedly more enjoyable to play, earning it a place on our list of zombie games.</p><h3 id="5-The-Walking-Dead"><a href="#5-The-Walking-Dead" class="headerlink" title="5.The Walking Dead"></a>5.The Walking Dead</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-walking-dead-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-walking-dead-poster"                ></p><p>You play Lee Everett, a convicted murderer who takes in an orphaned young girl called Clementine as his charge. You’ll make choices that will have significant repercussions for your group members when you meet more survivors. The worst part is that you develop feelings for the people in your group.

It’s up to you and your allies to take the battle to the enemy, eliminate the Ridden, and recapture the planet, with humanity’s extinction on the line.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started today with Filmora’s powerful performance, user-friendly interface, and thousands of effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>There isn’t much to World War Z by itself, but there isn’t a better game for mow down dozens, if not hundreds, of zombies with a group of friends or strangers. It’s based in part on the Brad Pitt film from 2013. Nonetheless, it’s mainly an excuse to repeat the film’s one distinguishing attribute: swarms of monsters that rush down streets and crash around curves like a torrent through a breached dam.</p><p>It is undeniably influenced by the Left 4 Dead series (RIP). It does, however, have several modern game mainstays like selectable classes &amp; permanent progression. You may choose to play as a Horror flick, who gets extra health by rapidly killing enemies, a Fixer, who places traps in safe areas, or even one of four additional classes. Whatever character you select to level up first, you’ll get to fire a lot of lead into sliding walls of decaying flesh.</p><h3 id="2-Dying-Light-The-Following-3"><a href="#2-Dying-Light-The-Following-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Dying Light: The Following"></a>2.Dying Light: The Following</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dying-light-the-following-poster.jpg"                      alt="dying-light-the-following-poster"                ></p><p>Running over zombies has never been more fun. The Foregoing is really a DLC for Dying Light that eliminates much of the parkour again from the original game and instead places you behind the wheel of a car across a stretch of nearly spotless countryside. Splatter zombies spewing gore and leave tire tracks in their guts as you drive across the fields, attempting daring jumps. Just make sure you don’t get a monster head caught in your wipers.</p><h3 id="3-State-of-the-Decay-2-3"><a href="#3-State-of-the-Decay-2-3" class="headerlink" title="3.State of the Decay 2"></a>3.State of the Decay 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/state-of-the-decay-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="state-of-the-decay-2-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike Project Zomboid, which concentrates primarily on the concept of being an ordinary person in an unfair position, the States of Decay series tries to keep you amused with the beautiful midwestern countryside and Gorey entertaining combat even while your supplies run out and zombies smash down your gate.</p><p>The introduction of multiplayer in States of Decay 2 is probably the most intriguing new feature. Inviting people to help protect and hunt for your village greatly expands the scope of procedurally produced tales. It also enables you to put to the test all of those zombie outbreak survival tactics you’ve spent way too much time talking with your pals.</p><h3 id="4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019-3"><a href="#4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)"></a>4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resident-evil-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="resident-evil-2-poster"                ></p><p>Resident Evil 2’s sequel treads a thin line between the sluggish horror of the original Resident Evil game and the quicker (but still methodical) action of the post-Resident Evil 7 period. It succeeds in being both a worthy homage to the first Resident Evil 2 and the most important, playable RE games in years as a result of this. The key is the zombies, as you’d expect from a game that ranks among the zombie games. Even while the remake’s mobility and shooting controls seem to be more contemporary and streamlined, each zombie can only take so many shots - even headshot - before resurrecting. Even immediately in front of your eyes, or perhaps a few minutes later, when you believe you are secure.</p><p>In the remake of Resident Evil 2, the perfect aim isn’t enough to ensure your life. The most essential element is caution since you save ammunition by firing to stun rather than kill. You could even decide the zombies can take the passageway while you retain the ammunition. It’s still not as terrifying as the other major Resident Evil remake in terms of sheer dread. However, the Resident Evil 2’s remake is undoubtedly more enjoyable to play, earning it a place on our list of zombie games.</p><h3 id="5-The-Walking-Dead-3"><a href="#5-The-Walking-Dead-3" class="headerlink" title="5.The Walking Dead"></a>5.The Walking Dead</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-walking-dead-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-walking-dead-poster"                ></p><p>You play Lee Everett, a convicted murderer who takes in an orphaned young girl called Clementine as his charge. You’ll make choices that will have significant repercussions for your group members when you meet more survivors. The worst part is that you develop feelings for the people in your group. As a consequence, when bad things happen, you’ll feel as though you’ve just seen a real-life buddy being eaten rather than a video game character. People will die, unexpected events will occur, and choices will need to be made. You’ll have to live with the repercussions.</p><h3 id="6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil-3"><a href="#6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil-3" class="headerlink" title="6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil"></a>6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remaster-of-resident-evil-poster.png"                      alt="remaster-of-resident-evil-poster"                ></p><p>The utter loneliness of becoming one of the last humans with a heartbeat within some several-mile radius is something that the first Resident Evil gets right that many zombie games miss out on. Resident Evil High-Definition Remaster is a somewhat updated version of Resident Evil GameCube update from 2002, maintaining the terrible desolation in its entirety. Don’t get us wrong: the 2015 remake should have done a lot more (those pre-rendered backdrops are starting to seem a little fuzzy these days), but what’s there is still a landmark survival horror classic.</p><p>The Resident Evil update isn’t just one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective on the undead; it’s one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective what to do, in particular, with one that seems to have ceased to move. You would like to make sure you put zombies down with just a headshot or burn their bodies afterward because if you don’t, the monster known as a “crimson head” will spring up later. Shivers go down your spine just uttering the word.</p><h3 id="7-The-Last-of-Us-3"><a href="#7-The-Last-of-Us-3" class="headerlink" title="7.The Last of Us"></a>7.The Last of Us</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-last-of-us-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-last-of-us-poster"                ></p><p>The Last of Us, which won the game of Year in 2013, is still the best zombie game ever made over six years later. It sends you on a perilous cross-country journey across a largely post-human America. The planet is filled with desperate weapon survivalists, a totalitarian government, and violent rebel groups, apart from mushroom-brained undead with fangs eager to tear your jugular out. The greatest part is that you have to do it all with a sassy young woman who alternates between making fun of you and rescuing your life.</p><p>The journey of Joel and Ellie would be both dark and terrifying. The decaying, gloomy surroundings set the tone for the stealth&#x2F;survival action, making the tension almost unbearable.</p><h3 id="8-Back-4-Blood-3"><a href="#8-Back-4-Blood-3" class="headerlink" title="8.Back 4 Blood"></a>8.Back 4 Blood</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/back4blood-poster.jpg"                      alt="back4blood-poster"                ></p><p>Back 4 Blood is an action-packed cooperative first-person action from the highly popular Left 4 Dead series developers.

Choose the camera angle carefully"></a>1. Choose the camera angle carefully</h4><p>Unlike conventional videos, most webcam videos are recorded from a single camera position. You should place the camera at the straight angle since this type of camera position is frequently used in tutorials, software walkthroughs or gaming videos. However, if you choose a low-angle or a high-angle shot, make sure that the subject of the shot is placed at the very center of the frame.</p><h4 id="2-Make-sure-that-there-is-enough-light-in-the-shot"><a href="#2-Make-sure-that-there-is-enough-light-in-the-shot" class="headerlink" title="2. Make sure that there is enough light in the shot"></a>2. Make sure that there is enough light in the shot</h4><p>The importance of good lighting in a webcam video is often overlooked. Although using professional lighting equipment during a webcam video production may not be necessary, it is still important that a person or objects in the video are properly lit. You can combine atmospheric sources of light with artificial ones such as common lamps or LED spotlights.</p><h4 id="3-Use-an-external-microphone"><a href="#3-Use-an-external-microphone" class="headerlink" title="3.Use an external microphone"></a>3.Use an <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Most webcams of the latest generation have a built-in microphone, but if you would like to be sure that your voiceover is impeccable, we suggest using an external shotgun microphone. This type of microphone rejects atmospheric noises from 30 degrees on both sides, while perfectly capturing the sounds coming directly from the front.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-for-Editing-the-Recorded-Webcam-Video"><a href="#Best-Video-Editor-for-Editing-the-Recorded-Webcam-Video" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editor for Editing the Recorded Webcam Video"></a>Best Video Editor for Editing the Recorded Webcam Video</h2><p>Despite being one of the best screen and webcam recorders on the market, the video editing options Filmora Scrn offers still lack the depth of more advanced video editing software products.

Both software products let its users choose whether they want to post a video on YouTube, Facebook or Vimeo.</p><p>Each software lets you choose from a number of popular video file formats and allows you to select the resolution of the file you’re exporting. But please be noted that there are some length limit or size limit when upload recorded webcam videos. For example, by default, YouTube allows you to upload videos which are up to 15 minutes’ long and the maximum file size is 128GB. If you want to upload longer videos, you may need to <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/71673?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&hl=en&oco=0" >verify your account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before uploading.</p><p>In order to share a webcam video to any of the online platforms, we mentioned in this article you simply have to click on the Export button, select the platform to which you’d like to upload your video and adjust the export settings.</p><h4 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h4><p>Webcam videos can be used for a wide array of business and entertainment purposes, but regardless of the reason why you are producing a video, it is still important to do everything in your power to create a high-quality video.

If you would like to make sure that your webcam videos are always captured in the best quality possible, then you should consider purchasing an external webcam. However, before you reach the decision which webcam model you want to buy there are a few things you should take into consideration.</p><p>The quality of the video you’ll be able to create depends on the maximum resolution your webcam can produce. If video quality is really important to you, our advice is to acquire a webcam that can create a video in <strong>1280X960P</strong> <strong>resolution</strong> or higher.</p><p><strong>Frame rate</strong> ensures that your videos will always look smooth and that’s the reason why your webcam should produce <strong>at least 25 frames per second</strong>. Furthermore, the sound quality is as important as video quality, which is why you should make sure that your webcam has a built-in microphone capable of capturing clear high-quality sound or you should external microphone is necessary.</p><p>The <strong>connection options</strong> the webcam of your choice offers should play a part in your decision-making process, especially if you intend to create webcam videos from a desktop computer. Features such as <strong>mounting options</strong> or <strong>auto zoom</strong> should also be considered before purchasing a webcam.</p><p>Users in need of a high-quality webcam capable of remarkable performances should try using <a class="link"   href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/4k-pro-webcam" >Logitech 4K pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> webcam designed for video conferencing, video recording or streaming. This Logitech’s model comes equipped with 4K UHD video recording option, built-in mic, background replacement feature and numerous other options that make webcam video recording look simple.</p><p>On the other hand, if you are looking for a more affordable webcam then <a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/webcams/lifecam-hd-3000/t3h-00011" >Microsoft LifeCam HD 3000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a near perfect choice for you.

Choose the camera angle carefully"></a>1. Choose the camera angle carefully</h4><p>Unlike conventional videos, most webcam videos are recorded from a single camera position. You should place the camera at the straight angle since this type of camera position is frequently used in tutorials, software walkthroughs or gaming videos. However, if you choose a low-angle or a high-angle shot, make sure that the subject of the shot is placed at the very center of the frame.</p><h4 id="2-Make-sure-that-there-is-enough-light-in-the-shot-3"><a href="#2-Make-sure-that-there-is-enough-light-in-the-shot-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Make sure that there is enough light in the shot"></a>2. Make sure that there is enough light in the shot</h4><p>The importance of good lighting in a webcam video is often overlooked. Although using professional lighting equipment during a webcam video production may not be necessary, it is still important that a person or objects in the video are properly lit. You can combine atmospheric sources of light with artificial ones such as common lamps or LED spotlights.</p><h4 id="3-Use-an-external-microphone-3"><a href="#3-Use-an-external-microphone-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Use an external microphone"></a>3.Use an <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Most webcams of the latest generation have a built-in microphone, but if you would like to be sure that your voiceover is impeccable, we suggest using an external shotgun microphone. This type of microphone rejects atmospheric noises from 30 degrees on both sides, while perfectly capturing the sounds coming directly from the front.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-for-Editing-the-Recorded-Webcam-Video-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Editor-for-Editing-the-Recorded-Webcam-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editor for Editing the Recorded Webcam Video"></a>Best Video Editor for Editing the Recorded Webcam Video</h2><p>Despite being one of the best screen and webcam recorders on the market, the video editing options Filmora Scrn offers still lack the depth of more advanced video editing software products.

But, as you most probably know, most of these documents are large in size and somewhat difficult to share. Instead of wasting time waiting for a file to upload, you can simply take a screenshot and create a file that is easy to share within seconds.</p><p>On the other hand, The Internet contains such a vast amount of information, that it is sometimes easier to just capture an entire screen than it is to share a link. Luckily, you don’t have to be a skilled photo editor who knows how to merge several screenshots of a scroll page of any kind, into a single image, because there are many easier ways to accomplish this task.

Get to Know Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 is a completely free screen recording app. The app does not have any premium service to upgrade.

These advance options are generally available in premium screen recorders, but you are getting them for free on Screen Recorder Pro. Therefore, you should definitely download the application on your PC and use it for screen recording.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Here are the best alternatives to record screen on Windows 10.</p><h3 id="Filmora"><a href="#Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora is a professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that has a built-in video editor. Therefore, you do not need separate applications for recording the screen and editing out video like a pro. Besides, the application is suitable for all types of recordings starting from application screen and webcam to videos games and web interfaces.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-recording-screen.jpg"                      alt="wondershare screen recorder"                ></p><p>Most importantly, you can capture at 4K resolution and you can add voiceover if you want.

Get to Know Screen Recorder Pro"></a>Part 1. Get to Know Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 is a completely free screen recording app. The app does not have any premium service to upgrade. Even though it is available free of cost, the features and functionalities are enough for high-quality screen recording activity.

Besides, there are various advanced options available such as record specific areas or record without cursor. These advance options are generally available in premium screen recorders, but you are getting them for free on Screen Recorder Pro. Therefore, you should definitely download the application on your PC and use it for screen recording. Here are the steps to download –</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Microsoft Store.</p><p>Step 2: Search for “screen recorder pro for win10”.</p><p>Step 3: Select the first app from the search result page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/search-recorder-pro-store.jpg"                      alt="search recorder from store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click on Get button to download and install Screen Recorder Pro APK automatically.</p><p>Once the downloading is complete, you can launch the application from the Start menu.</p><p>Here are the steps to follow to record any screen on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Launch Screen Recorder Pro application from Start menu.</p><p>Step 2: You need to configure the parameters such as video encoder, FPS, quality, audio source and likewise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="launch screen recorder pro"                ></p><p>Step 3: You have to select full screen(monitor icon) or custom screen(area icon at the extreme right corner).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="screen recorder pro customize screen"                ></p><p>Step 4: Finally, click on Record button to start recording.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.
