However, QuickTime is not just a simple media player to play video and audio files. Do you know that you can record your Mac screen with QuickTime? Not just recording the screen video, you can capture your screen with audio. This means QuickTime screen recording with audio feature allows you to record video of any video streaming platform such as YouTube by playing them on your Mac screen.</p><p>Even though QuickTime Player screen recording feature is inbuilt, the audio capturing feature does not come pre-installed. You will need to install a QuickTime extension so that you can record the audio along with screen video. In this article, we will illustrate QuickTime how to record screen with sound, and we will provide you with a better alternative to get the job done in simple steps.</p><ol><li><p><a href="#part1">Steps to Use QuickTime Record Screen and Audio</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#part2">How to Trim Videos in QuickTime Player</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#part3">QuickTime Alternative to Record and Edit Videos</a></p></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-Steps-to-Use-QuickTime-Record-Screen-and-Audio"><a href="#Part-1-Steps-to-Use-QuickTime-Record-Screen-and-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Steps to Use QuickTime Record Screen and Audio"></a>Part 1. Steps to Use QuickTime Record Screen and Audio</h2><p>If you are going to record a video playing on your Mac, QuickTime is a great choice. You can record your screen perfectly but the only issue is that QuickTime player screen recording audio feature is not available. That does not mean you cannot record screen as well as audio with QuickTime. Here are the steps on QuickTime how to record screen with sound.</p><p>Step 1: You will have to install a free extension called SoundFlower so that you can record audio through QuickTime along with recording the screen. Therefore, download <a class="link"   href="https://soundflower.en.softonic.com/mac" >SoundFlower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> free extension software. The main job of SoundFlower is to channel the audio playing from one application to another. Install SoundFlower application on your Mac from the downloaded file.</p><p>Step 2: Once you have installed SoundFlower on your Mac, restart your computer. This will ensure that there is no issue with QuickTime screen recording with sound.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Apple menu and open System Preferences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/system-preferences.jpg"                      alt="system preferences"                ></p><p>Step 4: Go to Sound tab and from Sound Output, select SoundFlower(2ch) option. This will make SoundFlower the active output by feeding the audio signal directly to SoundFlower instead of system speakers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-soundflower.jpg"                      alt="soundflower"                ></p><p>Step 5: Now, it is time for QuickTime player screen recording with audio. Launch QuickTime and go to File &gt; New Screen Recording option.</p><p>Step 6: You can start recording anytime you want by pressing the Record button. Make sure that sound source is selected as SoundFlower(2ch) and quality is selected as high. You can record any video that you are playing on the browser as well as record your gameplay with audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-start-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="quicktime screen recording"                ></p><p>Step 7: Once you are done recording, press the Stop button. You can go to File &gt; Save option to save the recorded video file.</p><p>Once your recording is over, you should go to Apple Menu &gt; System Preferences &gt; Sound tab and select Sound Output as Internal Speakers.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Trim-Videos-in-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Trim-Videos-in-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Trim Videos in QuickTime Player"></a>Part 2. How to Trim Videos in QuickTime Player</h2><p>You may need to trim out some parts of the video to get rid of the unwanted parts and keep only the important parts. You can do the trim work easily in QuickTime Player and here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Launch QuickTime Player and go to File &gt; Open File option. Select the video file that you want to trim.</p><p>Step 2: Once the video file opens, go to Edit &gt; Trim option. You can also press Command + T on your keyboard.</p><p>Step 3: You will see a yellow bar at the bottom containing the entire length of the video. In order to trim the video, you have to drag the handles from either side to trim out the unwanted parts. Therefore, after trimming, whatever the length of the video is there inside the yellow bar, the part of the video will remain and the out parts will be trimmed out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-triming-quicktime.jpg"                      alt="start video triming quicktime"                ></p><p>Step 4: You can preview the trimmed video by clicking the Play button beside the play icon.

Running a session online can be a daunting task - with the right tools, information, and resources it can be smooth sailing. There are three main video conferencing apps available, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and an app that trumps them all - Google Meet.</p><p>Google Meet is a video calling app that comes fully equipped with numerous features, such as screen presenting.

Whether it is a meeting, online class, or brainstorming session, it becomes a whole lot easier with a PowerPoint slideshow - bringing everyone on the same page!</p><p>You must be wondering <strong>how to share ppt in Google Meet</strong>, well the process is fairly simple and extremely functional. You will only need two tools to execute this screen-sharing process, a web browser, and Microsoft PowerPoint. We would advise that you use Google Chrome as your web browser as it works best with Google Meet.</p><p>Just a heads up, when you are presenting your screen on Google Meet, everyone can see what you display, so it’s best to open up your PowerPoint slides before joining the meeting so there are no surprises!</p><ol><li>Open the Microsoft PowerPoint Slides on your laptop, the model or brand of the laptop does not matter, as long as you have Microsoft PowerPoint on it</li><li>Convert your slides from the default mode to browsed by an individual mode. If you have used Microsoft PowerPoint before, then you must know that in slideshow mode the slides appear in fullscreen making it difficult to switch between applications, therefore by converting the PowerPoint it will be windowed fullscreen, allowing the presenter to switch between applications. The process is simple, just click the “Slide Show” tab, then “Set Up Slide Show”, and from the drop-down menu press “Browsed by an Individual”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerpoint-browsed-by-individual.jpg"                      alt="set PowerPoint to individual browse"                ></p><ol><li>After setting up the PowerPoint slides, move over to Google Meet and join the meeting through the meeting link provided or schedule in a new meeting.

The screen is only being mirrored, therefore only the presenter has control over the device. Participants can only view it, not control the device.</p><ol><li><strong>Can you present when someone else is presenting?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, an individual can present when someone else is presenting. If you start presenting while someone else is already presenting, their screen presenting will pause and yours will start.</p><p><strong>Are You Ready to Present PPT on Google Meet?</strong></p><p>Presenting a ppt on Google Meet is not all that difficult, if you know what to do, how to do it, and when to do it, then you are good to go.

It’s fully compatible with all things made by Google – and it works by signing into your Google account, so your friends don’t need to do very much if you invite them to a call.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-duo-app.JPG"                      alt="Google Duo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 3\. [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/)<p>If you don’t intend to do much in the way of group chatting, then video calling in Messenger is a reliable way to see friends during the lockdown. Most people have Facebook, it will work with all their products, and it is as easy to join as clicking a link. The downside is that it only works if FB knows who you are. If you closed your account with them, then you will need to start from scratch. That being said, audio and video are both clear, you can add in file sharing, and you have the option to instant message at all times. Plus, it will sync with your contacts in much the same way as Google Duo will.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/messenger-app.JPG"                      alt="Facebook Messenger"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Rounding-Up"><a href="#Rounding-Up" class="headerlink" title="Rounding Up"></a>Rounding Up</h2><p>So if you can’t work out how to make a WhatsApp call from a PC, try one of our other recommendations for keeping in touch.

Record Hangout Sessions on Phone"></a>Part 3. Record Hangout Sessions on Phone</h2><p>If you are using Google Hangouts from your phone and you want to record hangouts call and meeting sessions, we have different methods for iPhone and Android.</p><p><strong>For iPhone:</strong></p><p>If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you do not have to install any external app. This is because iOS 11 comes with an inbuilt screen recording feature. You can get access to this screen recorder from Control Center. If it is not readily available, you have to activate the feature and start recording the screen which is Hangouts calls and meetings here. Here are the steps you have to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open Settings app and go to on Control Centre.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and find Screen Recording option and turn it on.</p><p>Step 3: Open Google Hangouts app and start video call or meeting that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: Open Control Centre on your iPhone by swiping down or up as applicable.</p><p>Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you can start your Hangouts call or meeting.</p><p><strong>For Android:</strong></p><p>Android OS does not include any inbuilt screen recording option. Therefore, you have to install an external screen recording app for recording hangouts sessions. We recommend you install Mobizen screen recorder app on your Android smartphone so that you can record your Hangouts sessions as well as anything on your screen. It is a completely free app and there is no watermark issue. Here are the steps to follow to record Google Hangout with Mobizen screen recorder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mobizen-screenrecorder.jpg"                      alt="mobizen screen recorder"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and install Mobizen screen recorder.</p><p>Step 2: Open Mobizen screen recorder and you will see some icons on your screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open Google Hangouts and start your video call.</p><p>Step 4: Tap on Record icon of Mobizen screen recorder on the screen to start recording.</p><p>Step 5: When you are done, tap on Stop icon on your screen.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The answer to the question “Can you record a Google hangout?” is yes. You can use the default Google Hangouts screen recording option if you have G Suite subscription. If not, you can use Wondershare Filmora not only to record Hangout sessions but also edit the recorded video like a pro. If you are an iPhone user, you can use the inbuilt screen recorder.

Record Hangout Sessions on Phone"></a>Part 3. Record Hangout Sessions on Phone</h2><p>If you are using Google Hangouts from your phone and you want to record hangouts call and meeting sessions, we have different methods for iPhone and Android.</p><p><strong>For iPhone:</strong></p><p>If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you do not have to install any external app. This is because iOS 11 comes with an inbuilt screen recording feature. You can get access to this screen recorder from Control Center. If it is not readily available, you have to activate the feature and start recording the screen which is Hangouts calls and meetings here. Here are the steps you have to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open Settings app and go to on Control Centre.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and find Screen Recording option and turn it on.</p><p>Step 3: Open Google Hangouts app and start video call or meeting that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: Open Control Centre on your iPhone by swiping down or up as applicable.</p><p>Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you can start your Hangouts call or meeting.</p><p><strong>For Android:</strong></p><p>Android OS does not include any inbuilt screen recording option. Therefore, you have to install an external screen recording app for recording hangouts sessions. We recommend you install Mobizen screen recorder app on your Android smartphone so that you can record your Hangouts sessions as well as anything on your screen. It is a completely free app and there is no watermark issue. Here are the steps to follow to record Google Hangout with Mobizen screen recorder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mobizen-screenrecorder.jpg"                      alt="mobizen screen recorder"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803115/14559" target="_top" id="1803115"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803115"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803115/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and install Mobizen screen recorder.</p><p>Step 2: Open Mobizen screen recorder and you will see some icons on your screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open Google Hangouts and start your video call.</p><p>Step 4: Tap on Record icon of Mobizen screen recorder on the screen to start recording.</p><p>Step 5: When you are done, tap on Stop icon on your screen.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The answer to the question “Can you record a Google hangout?” is yes.

If not, you can use Wondershare Filmora not only to record Hangout sessions but also edit the recorded video like a pro. If you are an iPhone user, you can use the inbuilt screen recorder.

You may use them to produce comprehensive recordings as well as recordings that are limited to a single component or window. The disadvantage is that the free versions of this software sometimes include some very inconvenient restrictions, such as a relatively short time usage or bearing of those annoying presence of watermarks, which might negatively affect the result somewhat.</p><p>We introduce you to an amazing recording software RecordCast by PearlMountain company to record your screen and webcams online. It is a web-based application designed to capture your screen, webcam, and microphone input data. The interface to use the application is very user-friendly. Moreover, it provides free usage capability of up to 5 minutes of maximum recording time. However, for longer recordings, you might need to upgrade them. Let’s have a detailed review of the RecordCast in the coming sections.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast"></a>Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast</h2><p>Software is best analyzed by the features it has to offer.

Moreover, the GUI of the web-based application is very easy to use that only needs a few steps to do the job.</p><p>**<strong>Multiple Recording Modes:</strong></p><p>With the 3 recording modes of the RecordCast, it leads all other similar software which usually has single recording modes. The three recording modes let you choose to record webcam + screen simultaneously or one at a time.</p><p>**<strong>All-in-One:</strong></p><p>The RecordCast is not only designed to record screens but with its video editing tools, you can now edit, trim, change colors, apply filters and put artistic effects on any video online. This amazing feature makes it a competitor for video editor tools too.</p><p>**<strong>Protected:</strong></p><p>With great care for privacy and security, RecordCast stores and edit your video or recordings locally. It doesn’t upload your content to the web servers instead, it never shares your content with any third party.</p><p>**<strong>Fair Pricing:</strong></p><p>The free version of RecordCast let you record a screen or webcam for a maximum of 5 minutes. However, it can be upgraded to its premium version so you can avail all its features by only paying 2.99 $ per month. This is very fair considering other similar software pricing.</p><p>**<strong>Compatibility:</strong></p><p>Due to the online nature of the RecordCast, it is compatible with any computer. Whether it is a Mac or Windows, you will not have to set up any compatibility settings before using it. This gives it an edge over other similar software.</p><p>**<strong>No Storage:</strong></p><p>Normally, you need to download an application and then install it for its usage.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="OptiDrive-Specialists-Judgment"><a href="#OptiDrive-Specialists-Judgment" class="headerlink" title="OptiDrive Specialists Judgment"></a>OptiDrive Specialists Judgment</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a screen recording program for Windows that allows users to capture a complete screen or a select area of it, as well as record narrator voice or system noises and improve the overall quality of the individual clip. Within a PC, the system may be utilized to create professional-looking films. Camera video recording is supported by EaseUS RecExperts, allowing users to shoot movies inside the webcam or as an overlay, allowing for higher levels of involvement. You may record the whole screen, a specific region, or even a locked window with EaseUS RecExperts. Additionally, while recording, you may annotate your screen, label an area, and do other editing activities. You can rapidly export or distribute your recording to various platforms, depending on your preferences.</p><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a multi-purpose but simple-to-use Windows screen recorder that allows you to record and capture everything on your computer’s screen. Thanks to its simple and well-organized interface, you can get started quickly. You may record your screen, audio, and camera independently or all at once. In addition, the game recording option enables you to record your games in whatever way you desire. Annotation, cutting, watermark insertion, and other sophisticated editing tools are included in the program. The recordings may be exported in a variety of file formats, including MP4, AVI, and WMV. They may even upload the created video to YouTube immediately. Noise reduction and audio enhancement are also included in the software’s capabilities. It comes with its game recording mode, capable of capturing popular 2D&#x2F;3D games in 4K UHD quality. Users may use the built-in task planner to complete their recording tasks on time and in an automatic manner.</p><h2 id="1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications"><a href="#1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="1. Price and Tech Specifications"></a>1. Price and Tech Specifications</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts cost $11.97 a month, $23.97 a year, or $69.95 for the rest of your life. A single license for one machine is included in this price. It’s worth noting that you can test out the program for free. The trial version restricts you to two-minute recordings and adds a watermark to your movies.</p><p>Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Mac OS are all supported by EaseUS RecExperts. Initially, EaseUS Screen Recorder was only available for Windows, but a Mac OS version was eventually published. The program will be installed as a standalone app on your system disk. There are no further add-ons required. When recording games, RecExperts also allows you to alter the frame rate up to 60 frames per second. RecExperts is starting to look like a first-class application for all kinds of on-screen recording requirements, with the ability to output to 10+ commonly used recording formats (including MP4, MOV, and MP3), the ability to make GIFs directly from screen captures, and the ability to automatically stop and split recordings based on time or file size limits.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-RecExperts"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-RecExperts" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Use RecExperts"></a>2. How to Use RecExperts</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a premium screen recording software for Windows and Mac OS created by EaseUS.com. It’s a multi-purpose screen recorder that can do both screen recording and Webcam recording. RecExperts may also record full-screen or a specific part of the screen. The free trial version of RecExperts can be downloaded fast and conveniently from the EaseUS website, and the installation can be started right away.</p><p>Step 1: Launch EaseUS RecExperts</p><p>As can be seen in the screenshot below, the first function that is pre-selected for us when we launch the RecExperts program is the one that is necessary for capturing the complete default computer display. We have simple access to all of the software’s key functionalities as well as the main settings menu for modifying, among other things, the default file formats utilized, from this main program window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/easeus-recexperts.jpg"                      alt="easeus recexperts"                ></p><p>Step 2: Setup the Recording</p><p>For improved content distribution, you may record the single Webcam or use the Webcam as an overlay on a movie. With simplicity, you may pick full-screen recording, a specific portion of the screen, or a single window. Simply pressing the orange “REC” button will start the recording process; the main program windows will vanish at this point, being replaced by a smaller control window, as seen below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><p>Step 3: Finish&#x2F;Save Recording</p><p>We may finish the recording by clicking the red “stop” button after the screen recording is complete (which will, by default, include any sound outputted by the device during this process). When the recording is finished and the stop button is pushed, the RecExperts program will open the freshly recorded clip in the RecExperts editing suite, where we may continue to work with the material:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-recoring.jpg"                      alt="save recording"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3. Pros and Cons"></a>3. Pros and Cons</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is one of the finest screen recorders available whether you’re producing webinars or need to record movies on your PC. This powerful program lets you capture a portion of your screen, overlay video from a camera, and record audio on top of it all. RecExperts supports 4K recording and includes several useful tools to enhance the impact of your films.</p><p>**<strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio and video from the webcam are captured.</li><li>An automated recording is supported.</li><li>Video quality, frame rate, and audio bitrate may all be adjusted.</li><li>GPU-assisted hardware acceleration is supported.</li><li>(Basic) video editing tools built-in</li><li>The picture formats BMP, JPG, PNG, GIF, and TIFF are all supported by EaseUS Screen Recorder.</li><li>Recordings may be used to extract screenshots or audio samples.</li><li>Support for ten distinct output file types is complete.</li><li>EaseUS RecExperts supports video formats MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, FLV, and ASF, as well as audio formats MP3.</li></ul><p>**<strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>The editing options are limited.</li><li>A little bit pricey</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537546&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/7_copy_2_2_hdpro.png"                      border="0"                >HD Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Alternative-to-RecExperts"><a href="#4-Alternative-to-RecExperts" class="headerlink" title="4.

Filmora, on the other hand, maybe of interest if you want additional bells and whistles. RecExperts Screen Recorder has compiled a list of reasons why you should look into screen recorder software. It is a useful screen recording app for Windows 10&#x2F;8.2.8&#x2F;7&#x2F;XP that allows you to capture any movement in any size. We can capture the screen using screen projection software, but it isn’t enough to generate a convincing movie or YouTube video instructive lesson. We’ll need video recording and editing software that can provide a clear screen recording for this. This is why we looked at Wondershare Filmora, a video recorder and editor available for both Windows and Mac OS.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora’s video recording and editing software comes with a comprehensive range of video capture and editing features, making it the finest alternative to RecExperts screen recorder software. Filmora allows you complete control over everything from the screen’s size to how you capture and edit video. Not only that, but it also allows you to upload media files, record the screen with sound, export movies to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, GIF, MP3, modify video effects, Bitrate, Frame rate, and change the sound when transmitting to the online community. This keeps your movie looking neat while keeping it interesting. You may generate a green screen effect, make adjustments, add stickers, subtitles, add comments, cursor effects, notes, callouts, trim video, denoise it, increment, fade-in&#x2F;fade-out volume, and much more after the screen is selected for recording and recorded.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

It is a useful screen recording app for Windows 10&#x2F;8.2.8&#x2F;7&#x2F;XP that allows you to capture any movement in any size. We can capture the screen using screen projection software, but it isn’t enough to generate a convincing movie or YouTube video instructive lesson. We’ll need video recording and editing software that can provide a clear screen recording for this. This is why we looked at Wondershare Filmora, a video recorder and editor available for both Windows and Mac OS.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora’s video recording and editing software comes with a comprehensive range of video capture and editing features, making it the finest alternative to RecExperts screen recorder software. Filmora allows you complete control over everything from the screen’s size to how you capture and edit video. Not only that, but it also allows you to upload media files, record the screen with sound, export movies to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, GIF, MP3, modify video effects, Bitrate, Frame rate, and change the sound when transmitting to the online community. This keeps your movie looking neat while keeping it interesting. You may generate a green screen effect, make adjustments, add stickers, subtitles, add comments, cursor effects, notes, callouts, trim video, denoise it, increment, fade-in&#x2F;fade-out volume, and much more after the screen is selected for recording and recorded.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-Record-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#Steps-to-Record-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="**Steps to Record with Filmora:"></a>**<strong>Steps to Record with Filmora:</strong></h3><p>Step 1.

Games that allow you to progress quite effectively even without being active for an extended period are the best mobile idle games.</p><p>There is no limit to how many idle games you can play, and you can finish all your daily tasks in only minutes. It does not matter if you like to play Android RPGs, tycoon games, or whatnot. There are plenty of idle games out there for you to choose from.</p><p>In general, idle games fall into two categories: the true idle game, where you can leave your game running for hours but still gain progress (resources, levels, currency, etc. ), or the pseudo-idle game that claims to be idle. The latter category consists of idle clickers and the like, where progress is more likely to be made by tapping than simply being idle.</p><p>You need only know that idle games (if you find the right ones) can be delightful if you’re unfamiliar with either of them.

You will still need the proper hardware and software in order to be able to connect your TV, Tivo game console, or any other source of video and your PC or laptop. Keep in mind that you’ll also need a sufficient amount of data storage space if you want to record entire movies or TV shows from your PC. OK, let’s dive into what you will need to record a TV show from your PC right now.</p><h3 id="1-HD-PVR-or-Capture-Card"><a href="#1-HD-PVR-or-Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="1. HD-PVR or Capture Card"></a>1. HD-PVR or Capture Card</h3><p>These two components are the essential part of the setup you’ll need to record live TV on your PC. Although they basically do the same thing, which is to enable you to transfer the video or TV signal to the computer you are using to record the footage, there are some considerable differences between these two devices. To help you understand it, we have made a detailed explanation below based on our research. So you can choose the Capture Card or HD-PVR based on your situation correctly.</p><h4 id="Capture-Card"><a href="#Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="Capture Card"></a>Capture Card</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-card-recording-tv.jpg"                      alt="Record TV with Capture Card"                ></p><p>A capture card is a great choice for all PC users who don’t care too much about the quality of the footage they are recording. The device needs to be connected to a TV or a gaming console with component cables, while a free USB slot is needed in order to connect a capture card to your computer.</p><p>The price of capture cards usually varies from $50 for entry-level options to $150 for high-end devices, which makes it more affordable than its alternative, the HD-PVR. Capture cards often come equipped with its own video recording software. However, some of them don’t offer a video recording software capable of high performances, and for that reason, you must do a thorough research before you decide which capture card you want to buy. If you want to get an in-deep understanding of capture card, you can check this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Complete Introduction to Capture Card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and find out more about the best capture cards that are currently available on the market.</p><h4 id="HD-PVR"><a href="#HD-PVR" class="headerlink" title="HD-PVR"></a>HD-PVR</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hd-pvr-tv-recording.jpg"                      alt="Record TV with HD PVR devices"                ></p><p>The more powerful, but more expensive option for recording live TV from a PC is called HD-PVR or High Definition Personal Video Recorder, a box-shaped device that enables you to create near perfect video recordings of your favorite TV shows. The average price of an HD-PVR is approximately $200, even though high-end models can be even more expensive.</p><p>Most HD-PVR models feature their own video recording software, so you won’t have to spend additional money on the software you need to record a TV show from on a PC. Even if you don’t have an HD-PVR with its own built-in video recording software, obtaining a program that will enable you to record videos from a PC shouldn’t be too hard to find.</p><h3 id="2-Component-Cables"><a href="#2-Component-Cables" class="headerlink" title="2. Component Cables"></a>2. Component Cables</h3><p>The trouble with component cables is that they often must be purchased separately since most HD-PVR or capture cards manufacturers don’t include all the cables users need to connect a device to a TV and a computer. In most cases, you’ll just need a set of RCA cables, with ordinary red, yellow and white plugs to connect the capture card or an HD-PVR device to a TV. A simple USB cable can be used to establish a connection between a PC and the device you intend to use to record a TV show or any other TV-based video content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4737285&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/b2f83c409ce63012229fb9cd465bdcfe/products/copy_reporting_system.png"                      border="0"                >  KoolReport Pro  is an advanced solution for creating data reports and dashboards in PHP.

Video Recording Software</h3><p>You don’t have to worry if you were unlucky enough to get a capture card or HD-PVR that doesn’t have a built-in video recording software because the video recording software you can use to record TV shows from a PC are fairly common and easy to come by. Furthermore, all recent versions of the Windows OS, up until Windows 7 also provide ways to record live TV.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-tv-with-windows-media-center.jpg"                      alt="Record TV with Windows Media Center"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379"                      border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The Windows Media Center is the key entertainment feature on Windows 7 that enables its users to record TV shows, schedule recording sessions and watch the recorded videos from desktop and laptop computers.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Top-5-Best-Ps1-Emulators-for-PC"><a href="#Top-5-Best-Ps1-Emulators-for-PC" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Best Ps1 Emulators for PC"></a>Top 5 Best Ps1 Emulators for PC</h2><p>Sony released its first standalone console for video games, Playstation1 (nicknamed PS1), in 2001. The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.</p><h3 id="1-RetroArch-Emulator"><a href="#1-RetroArch-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="1.RetroArch Emulator"></a>1.RetroArch Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/retroarch-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="retroarch-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software.
