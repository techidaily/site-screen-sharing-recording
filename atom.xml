This can be done by adjusting your sound settings on the desktop as well as in the Skype application. Let’s see how:</p><ul><li>1. Turn on your desktop and tap the <strong>Sound</strong> icon at the right end of the Taskbar</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recording-device1.jpg"                      alt="recording-device1"                ></p><ul><li>2. Select the option <strong>Recording devices</strong></li><li>3. A small window will appear in which you have to Right-click on the   <strong>Microphone</strong>option and then select <strong>Properties</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microphone-properties2.jpg"                      alt="microphone-properties2"                ></p><ul><li>4. Another window will appear, tap on the <strong>Levels</strong> at the top and adjust the <strong>Microphone Boost</strong> to 0.0dB and tap <strong>OK</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microphone-boost3.jpg"                      alt="microphone-boost3"                ></p><ul><li>5. Now open Skype and click on the <strong>Tools</strong> option at the top. Select <strong>Options</strong> from it</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-options4.jpg"                      alt="skype-options4"                ></p><ul><li>6. A window will appear on the screen. Go to   <strong>Audio</strong> settings on the right side of the window</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-audio5.jpg"                      alt="skype-audio5"                ></p><ul><li>7.

Unlike other media players, QuickTime Player is not just for playing audio and video files. The application can record the screen on Mac and save the recordings on the hard drive. Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they <strong>cannot stop QuickTime screen recording</strong> following the standard procedure.</p><p>When the application fails to stop recording, it fails to save the recording as well. Therefore, QuickTime Player keeps recording the screen, and this slows down the Mac as it keeps occupying the system resources. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to QuickTime Player stop screen recording.

These days, it’s all too common for gamers to have to clear their hard drives when a new game is released.</p><p>Games like Call of Duty see the astonishing patch sizes: Warzone lately may mean you can only update a game rather than get a new one, and still, you’ll run out of space. It is possible to store hundreds of games using an external hard drive, making them available to you without downloading them again.</p><p>You will still need more storage, though an SSD is more efficient and recommended if you buy the Xbox Series S or Series X.</p><p>If you’re looking for a bit more space, we’ve created a list of the best Xbox external hard drives.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024"><a href="#Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024"></a><strong>Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive"><a href="#1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive" class="headerlink" title="1.

With this drive, you get a standard Seagate drive in a flashier case. The (admittedly quite nice) embossed Xbox logo and official green case are an additional $15-20. It’s a great choice if the price is right for you, and aesthetics are a concern. Esthetics are important to me, so I think this is the best choice. As often happens around big retail events, Seagate’s 2TB Game Drive in official Xbox green often drops in price, so though this is a great time to buy, we can expect further savings in the coming months.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01065S79E/" >Check on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Fast and Reliable</li><li>Vast Storage of 2TB</li><li>Compatible with different versions of Xbox.</li><li>It is a value for money hard drive.</li></ul><h4 id="2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive"><a href="#2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive" class="headerlink" title="2.

The metal topside gives it a bit of a shipping container aesthetic even though it’s not listed as an armored or “rugged” hard drive. The hard drive remains cool even after extensive usage and runs quietly without making any noise.</p><p>Although the drive’s write speed is not special at 130 megabytes per second, we found that it matched the console’s internal hard drive, So you can run the games directly from the hard drive without worrying about any lags or delays.</p><p>The best thing about this hard drive is that you can find it with different storage capacities ranging from 1Tb to 5Tb. So, the users have the option to choose suitable storage options according to their needs.</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBlack-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VNTFHD5" >Check On Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features</strong>:</p><ul><li>It is extremely portable</li><li>Always runs quietly and cool</li><li>The 3-year warranty is quite reasonable.</li><li>Price is high but is value for money.</li></ul><h4 id="3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance"><a href="#3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance" class="headerlink" title="3.

With a sleek, glossy design, a simple, elegant design, and a nice blue power-light on top, the Toshiba Canvio Advance is an attractive piece of kit. Works just fine. All the drives on this list match its read and write speeds, and it comes with a two-year warranty. Your Xbox console has a USB port that you can connect to, and proceed as usual…</p><p>Additionally, suppose you want to use it for PCs as well. In that case, it includes password protection and automatic backup of files, both of which make it a better budget pick than our previous budget pick, the Canvio Basics. There is only one real disadvantage to the Advance: it does not come in green, so you cannot match it with your console. Nonetheless, white looks slick next to many Xbox consoles. You cannot beat the price of the 1TB version, which is around $50 &#x2F; £50.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Canvio-Advance-Portable-External/dp/B08JKFY8FH/" >Check On Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Small and Compact In Size</li><li>Available in multiple colors.</li><li>Extremely affordable.</li><li>Standard speed but matches to that of your console.</li></ul><h4 id="4-Seagate-Expansion-8TB"><a href="#4-Seagate-Expansion-8TB" class="headerlink" title="4.

This is the ideal choice for those who use their Xbox Ones often and don’t want to worry about storage in the future. It is more expensive and requires an external power adapter (supplied), but it is a surprising device for its size. Seagate’s Expansion 8TB weighs 2.09 lbs and is considerably lighter than large rival capacity external hard drives, including the WD 8TB My Book drive, which weighs 2.9 lbs and measures 1.9 x 5.5 x 6.7 in.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.in/dp/B01HAPGEIE?tag=georiot-in-default-21&ascsubtag=grd-row-1888675391884567800-20&geniuslink=true" >View on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>A vast amount of storage space</li><li>Excellent value</li><li>It needs to be plugged into the mains due to its size and capacity</li><li>A bit large but the capacity is great.</li></ul><h4 id="5-OWC-Envoy-Pro-EX-SSD"><a href="#5-OWC-Envoy-Pro-EX-SSD" class="headerlink" title="5.

Despite being small, it feels solid and can survive bumps and drops as long as it is handled with care. Despite its size, it’s impressively stylish - for a hard drive - and can be hidden behind a gaming console.</p><p>Using the software on board, you can turn it into a PC external drive without a problem. This is also how we uncovered 411Mbps read speed and 248Mbps write speed using Crystal Disk Mark.

The Ken Burns effect involves slow-paced zoom and pan over a still image to evoke a sense of movement, so the audience believes that they are watching a video and not just a slide show of still photos. There are many editing tools that can help you add the Ken Burns effect to your video and Camtasia 9 is one of them.</p><p>One of the most positive impacts generated by the Camtasia Ken Burns effect is that it enables your still photos to be used in a video as though they were a part of it. The effect is not only easy to understand but also quite user-friendly to apply. That is why it is often used by beginners and amateur YouTubers and content creators to add flair to their videos. Let’s see how you can use the Camtasia Ken Burns effect.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Ken-Burns-Effect-in-Camtasia-9-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Ken-Burns-Effect-in-Camtasia-9-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Ken Burns Effect in Camtasia 9?"></a>How to Make a Ken Burns Effect in Camtasia 9?</h2><p>You have to bear in mind that Camtasia 9 isn’t the easiest editing software to use, and you will have to go through multiple steps to add the Ken Burns effect.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Open-a-New-Project-Import-Images"><a href="#Step-1-Open-a-New-Project-Import-Images" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Open a New Project &amp; Import Images"></a>Step 1. Open a New Project &amp; Import Images</h4><p>The first step you need to take to add the Ken Burns effect to your video is to open a new project in Camtasia 9. The next thing you have to do is import the images you want to use and add them to the Media Bin. This will enable you to work on the images and add the Ken Burns effect.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Adding-Camtasia-Ken-Burns-Effect"><a href="#Step-2-Adding-Camtasia-Ken-Burns-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Adding Camtasia Ken Burns Effect"></a>Step 2. Adding Camtasia Ken Burns Effect</h4><p>Now you need to right-click on the photo present on track 1 and select the duration. Set the duration to 30 seconds. Once you have done that, you need to position the play head at the end of the video. On the left side of the screen, there is a menu that allows you to choose animations. Ensure that your <strong>Zoom and Pan</strong> tab is visible and active.</p><p>The square you see in the Zoom-n-Pan tab should be dragged to the right, so it appears to be panning through the image while the photo moves toward the left. Here you will see a small arrow on track 1 on your timeline.</p><p>At this point, all you need to do is drag that particular arrow to the left, so it spreads across the length of your video. Play the preview by pressing the space bar, and you will see the Ken Burns effect in motion.</p><p>In Camtasia 9, you have the option to experiment with zooming and panning or both to create new styles of the Ken Burns effect. You will learn as you experiment and will be able to create some really interesting videos in the process.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087485/7443" target="_top" id="2087485">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087485" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087485/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Apply-Ken-Burns-Effect-with-the-Best-Alternative-to-Camtasia-9-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Apply-Ken-Burns-Effect-with-the-Best-Alternative-to-Camtasia-9-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Apply Ken Burns Effect with the Best Alternative to Camtasia 9 - Wondershare Filmora"></a>Apply Ken Burns Effect with the Best Alternative to Camtasia 9 - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>If you are looking for the best alternative to Camtasia 9 that makes adding the Ken Burns effect and other video editing features much easier, then Wondershare Filmora should be on your list of considerations.

Therefore, you have to pay equal attention to the video recording as well as voiceover recording. A voiceover is basically a person speaking in the background as the video is playing along to make proper sense as well as to add more context to the video.</p><p>A voiceover recording can be describing the video, explaining concepts, highlighting important points, and likewise. Generally, a voiceover is added to the video after the video is already recorded. In order to record a good voice over, there are certain essential elements you need to have beforehand. In this article, we will explain why and how to record a voice over and how to make a voice over good to get everyone’s attention and appreciation.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover"><a href="#1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="1. Why To Record A Voiceover?"></a>1. Why To Record A Voiceover?</h2><p>The engagement on a video depends both on how good the video content as well as how good the audio is. The audio in a video is not just about background music. A good voiceover can do wonders in terms of retaining the attention of the viewers as well as showcasing your personality traits.</p><p>A voice over recording is a must when you are making instructional, educational, and informational videos. Imagine watching a tutorial video where there is no voice to explain what is happening on the screen, everyone will leave the video immediately. Therefore, a voiceover essentially explains the video so that everyone can understand and even relate properly.</p><h2 id="2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over"><a href="#2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over" class="headerlink" title="2. Essential elements for a good voice over"></a>2. Essential elements for a good voice over</h2><p>You have to ensure that your voice over recording is great from all perspectives. There are certain essential elements that you have to get right in order to make a voice over mediocre to good and even great.</p><p><strong>Audio Clarity</strong></p><p>Every great voiceover has perfect voice quality and comfortable volume. Audiences may find it distracting if the voiceover recording has a muddy and muffled sound. They will definitely miss the important message that you may want to share through the video. Low volume will make people difficult to hear whereas too loud can cause irritation.</p><p>To ensure audio clarity, professionals use voice over recording studio. If you generally record voice over at home, make sure you do it when there is absolute silence in the background. Besides, the mic quality should be top-notch to pick your voice only as close to original and eliminate background noise.</p><p><strong>Pacing of Pitch</strong></p><p>Pacing is the speed of how fast or slow your pitch is. If you go too fast, your audience will not be able to catch you. On the contrary, the slow pace can be boring. It is important to have a natural pace for everyone to understand as well as stay interested. Therefore, maintain a good pace throughout the video but take pauses to add audio effects. Pauses are a part of pacing for allowing the listeners to grab information and for you to breathe properly so that mic does not catch it.</p><p><strong>Vocal Tone</strong></p><p>Vocal tone is about speaking in a pleasant, soothing but natural manner. You need to make sure that the tone has to be engaging but friendly. Sometimes, you may have to fake it but it must not sound fake or boring for the listeners. A proper vocal tone comes with regular practice and experimentation.</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong></p><p>Always make sure that you pronounce every word correctly. The listeners must clearly understand what you speak clearly. Avoid mumbling, over-enunciating, and shouting. At times, you may have to avoid your regional accent to make the audience understand with more clarity. Always ask feedback from listeners to be better at pronouncing certain words.</p><h2 id="3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over"><a href="#3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over" class="headerlink" title="3. How To Record A Voice Over?"></a>3. How To Record A Voice Over?</h2><p>Here are the steps to follow to record voiceover properly like professionals.</p><p><strong>Getting Ready</strong></p><ul><li>Location: Look for a quiet place to work. Professional voice artists opt for a soundproof room to cancel out external noise. However, you can even go for a quiet area where there is no distracting noise. Microphones can pick up ambient noise that will be reflected in the voiceover recording. Apart from human conversations, you will also have to be careful of the sound coming from electronic gadgets such as computer fans.</li><li>Microphone: Look for a top-notch microphone as per your budget. Consider using a pop filter if you are going to use an external mic. It helps to reduce the distracting sounds with certain alphabets as well as the sound of breathing. Among affordable microphones, you may use modern earbuds or headphones with mic that you use for your smartphone. There are many USB microphones available in the market at an affordable value.</li><li>Voiceover Recorder Software: You need a good-quality audio recording software to record voiceover as well as edit the recording as per requirement. There are many free as well as premium audio recording software available in the market today. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record voice over for any video like professionals as well as edit the recording of audio and video in the same software.</li></ul><p><strong>Writing A Proper Script</strong></p><p>The best way to sound professional during a voice over is to use a proper script. When you don’t use a script, then there can be a lot of pauses and you may try to think about what you will have to say next. When you use a script, you have everything planned out beforehand. Besides, you can also practice what to say when you have a script with pointers and even full explanation of each point. Try to read the script many times and be careful of the words and phrases that can be awkward. Adjust the script accordingly so that it will fit perfectly in the recording.</p><p><strong>Performing A Test Recording</strong></p><p>It is always advisable to go for a test recording to ensure that everything is working properly. In a test recording, you don’t have to go for the entire script but just a few paragraphs. Check if the audio is clear, the volume is at the right level, and the recording is seamless. Check the audio quality by using headphones and not computer speakers.</p><p>**<strong>Microphone Placement</strong> - If you keep the microphone too close to the mouth, there will be all kinds of weird sounds including air puffs. Too far placement will make your voice get fainted. The perfect placement should be about 6 to 8 inches from the mouth and it has to be slightly below the chin. Check the test recording carefully as some microphones can pick up sounds from the table and the computer.</p><p><strong>Recording Voice Over</strong></p><p>So by now, you have the video for which you want to record voiceover.

Chill, you don’t need a professional studio for this purpose. There is a lot of software, but zoom podcast recording is relatively more straightforward. A podcast is a collection of audio files that you can either download or listen to online using the internet. This article will help you learn to record podcasts using zoom.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom"><a href="#7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?"></a>7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?</h2><p>Recording a podcast on zoom is quite simple and easy. You don’t need to be a recording expert; you can get it done at home using your laptop. In this article, I will guide you on how to record a podcast using zoom step by step.</p><h5 id="Step1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#Step1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download and Install"></a>Step1 Download and Install</h5><p>The 1st step is downloading and installing zoom on your device. Next, create your zoom account by visiting the <a class="link"   href="https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/?url=https://zoom.us&id=5&geo=&ub=https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/&gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966AtsDXlasyuqO9r1vrbTzSdxKyOMLNsfNLa_RFZ12PRcu09P4sKnMcaAlUHEALw_wcB" >zoom website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Log in to this account with your installed software and enjoy zoom free. The free version allows you to record for 40 minutes. For longer calls, purchase the paid version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-1.jpg"                      alt="download and install zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones"><a href="#Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones"></a>Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones</h5><p>Zoom can use your device’s built-in microphone, but it is advised to use a high-quality external mic. It enhances the quality of your podcast tremendously. Plenty of external mics are available for under 50$, which can make a real difference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-2.jpg"                      alt="set up microphone and headphones"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise"><a href="#Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise"></a>Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise</h5><p>No one is interested in listening to what’s happening in the background while listening to your podcast. So, before pressing the ‘Record’ button, ensure your environment is as quiet as possible. You can take the following steps to reduce background noises.</p><ul><li>Turn off the fan, air conditioner, or any other noisy appliances.</li><li>Remove noisy kids, roommates, or pets.</li><li>Hang a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on your front door.</li><li>Shut your door and windows to avoid noise from outside sources, such as sirens, traffic horns, etc.</li><li>Avoid the rustling sound of paper or moving things around your desk.</li><li>Install noise-canceling software to filter out any background noise.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-3.jpg"                      alt="eliminate background noise"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker"><a href="#Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker"></a>Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker</h5><p>Wouldn’t it be easier to edit your podcast if you recorded audio tracks for each speaker separately? Zoom has this feature of recording separate audio tracks.</p><p>To enable this, go to your zoom ‘Settings’ and click on the ‘Recording’ setting.

Can you record a podcast virtually?</h3><p>Yes, a podcast can be recorded virtually using suitable software and equipment, such as a microphone and headphones.

Its features, such as a built-in recorder and separate audio tracks for each speaker, make it great for podcasting. But you can’t use it for professional purposes because it compresses the audio files and reduces their quality.</p><h3 id="3-How-do-I-host-a-podcast-on-Zoom"><a href="#3-How-do-I-host-a-podcast-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="3.

How to disable crossplay? How about cross-progression? Further, which platform is the best to play on? What’s the difference between Steam and Origin?</p><p>In this article, all of the questions above will be answered. No doubt, we have seen a massive increase in the popularity of Apex Legends. Millions of players are grouping in EA’s battle royal game, and it is quite clear why they like it so much. It is a free-to-play game with some quality graphics and gameplay. This game’s core is based around looting and shooting, and it offers a few interesting twists in the battle royal format.</p><hr><h4 id="In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered"><a href="#In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered" class="headerlink" title="In this article, these questions will be answered"></a>In this article, these questions will be answered</h4><hr><p>Apex Legends Gameplay Basics:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-gameplay.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In this battle royal game, you are a part of a 3-person squad. There are 14 playable characters to choose from, and they are called legends in the game. If you compare all legends, you will find that they are equal in strength, speed, and firepower. It’s their special abilities that make them different from each other. Every character has a unique ability that can help you in-game to leverage other players. So, you can choose a legend that suits your playstyle and is a perfect fit for your squad.</p><p>Teamwork is very critical in this game. When you jump into the battleground, there are two teammates on your side. Make sure to stick with them during the match if you want to win it. By working together, you can protect each other and outmatch the enemies by combining your abilities. You can stay connected with your teammates using the in-game communication system. You can mark different locations, highlight threats, pinpoint the location of gear pieces, and tell your teammates in which direction you are going.</p><p>There is a ring around the battleground that shrinks after fixed short intervals. As the rink shrinks, it forces the players into a smaller space on the map, and as a result, we observe more fights between different teams. If you want to win the game, then you have to be the last team standing. If your teammates are knocked down, then you can revive them and pick them up. If they are completely killed, you can pick up their banner in a fixed amount of time and have them jumped back into the game once again. This feature makes this game different from other battle royal games where if your teammate dies once, then he stays dead the rest of the game.</p><p>One thing that you must keep in mind while playing this game is that killing an opponent is a bit longer than other FPS (First Person Shooting) games. To kill an opponent, you may need to rely on several headshots, your legends’ unique ability, and the support of your teammates.</p><p>Although this game is free of cost, it offers several in-game purchases. You can purchase Apex Coins, which is an in-game currency. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ingame-purchase.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You can use it to purchase loot boxes that contain skins and costumes. There are two locked characters in the game also, and you need to purchase them with Apex coins. So, you can get the maximum out of this game by spending some money and giving time to this game.</p><hr><h4 id="Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not"><a href="#Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?"></a><strong>Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?</strong></h4><p>Yes, Apex Legends is a cross-platform game. Initially, it wasn’t a cross-platform game, but Apex became a cross-platform game after an update in autumn 2020. It means that two players playing on two different devices can group in a squad and play the game. Let’s explain it with an example. Suppose you have a pc and your friend has a PS4. Both of you can play together in a squad, even if you both have two different types of devices.</p><h4 id="How-to-turn-off-crossplay"><a href="#How-to-turn-off-crossplay" class="headerlink" title="How to turn off crossplay?"></a><strong>How to turn off crossplay?</strong></h4><p>Firstly, crossplay is enabled by default. Assume now you’re playing apex on PS4&#x2F;switch&#x2F;Xbox using a controller, you might be reluctant to crossplay against a PC player using keyboard and mouse. Because you might think that isn’t fair. So why don’t we turn it off and play only with game console players?</p><p>Step1, to disable it, you need to go to the setting button at the lobby’s right bottom, as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting1.png"                      alt="ape-setting1"                ></p><p>Step 2, under the gameplay tab, scroll down, and you can find cross-platform play.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting2.png"                      alt="apex-setting2"                ></p><h4 id="Does-it-have-cross-progression"><a href="#Does-it-have-cross-progression" class="headerlink" title="Does it have cross-progression?"></a><strong>Does it have cross-progression?</strong></h4><p>Unfortunately, because of technical and legal issues, no. It means that your characters&#x2F;purchased items will not be synced through platforms. Simply put, you will have to start all over again if you change your platform.</p><hr><h4 id="Which-platform-is-the-best-to-play-on"><a href="#Which-platform-is-the-best-to-play-on" class="headerlink" title="Which platform is the best to play on?"></a><strong>Which platform is the best to play on?</strong></h4><p>The best thing about Apex Legends is that it has multiplatform support. You can play it on different platforms like:</p><p><strong>Microsoft Xbox One S and X</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-one.jpg"                                     >You can play Apex Legends on Xbox One S, but you may need to compromise a little bit and play on a low resolution for better fps. Although the game will run just fine, you may need to make some adjustments to your graphics settings. You can play this game on 720p on Xbox One S, so make sure to sit a little closer to your screen to see everything.</p><p>If you want to get Apex’s best experience on Xbox consoles, you should play it on Xbox One X. If you switch from Xbox one S to Xbox one X, you will see a significant difference in the game performance. On the X version, you can run the game on 1080p. It offers overall better performance in terms of gameplay as compared to other Xbox variants.</p><p><strong>Xbox Series X and S</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-seriesx.jpg"                                     >Xbox series S and X are the latest generations of Xbox. They rival their competitor PS5 and offer competitive performance when you compare these consoles with a PS5. They do offer better gaming performance and better graphics. But, the question is, Can you play Apex on the latest generations of Xbox? The answer is yes. You will get better performance in terms of graphics and FPS but currently, the game isn’t fully optimized for the latest generations. In the coming days it is expected that the game will be optimized for the latest consoles and you can enjoy the game to the fullest. Currently, you can enjoy 1440p gaming on these consoles and can get up to 120fps.</p><p><strong>Sony PlayStation 4</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ps4.png"                                     >You can also play Apex Legends on Sony PlayStation 4. Although you can play it on the standard PS4, if you want to get the best gaming experience, then you should play it on PS4 Pro. On PS4, you need to have a PlayStation Plus subscription if you want to play online multiplayer games, but in the case of Apex Legends, you do not need it.</p><p><strong>Sony PlayStation 5</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ps5-poster.png"                      alt="ps5-poster"                ></p><p>Sony PlayStation 5 is a next-generation console, and luckily Apex Legends is already playable on it. PS5 offers improved performance and better graphics as compared to its previous versions. If you were previously playing on PS4 and just switched to PS5, you can also retain all your progress and skins on PS5 also. You can use the same EA account and start enjoying Apex Legends on 1440p screen resolution.</p><p><strong>PC</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PC-apex.png"                                     >If you want to do competitive gaming in Apex Legends, then PC is the most suitable choice for you. It is because when you play using a mouse and keyboard instead of controllers, then your aim and movement are more precise. As it is an FPS category game, you can use a monitor with a high refresh rate to have smooth gameplay and reduce the lag. You must keep in mind that you need a PC with some good specs that can provide you with at least 60fps in the game. It would be best if you aim for a PC that can provide you maximum fps. 120 is the most recommended figure here.</p><p>PC Requirements For Apex Legends:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Components</strong></th><th><strong>Minimum</strong></th><th><strong>Recommended</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 7 (64-Bit)</td><td>Windows 7 (64-Bit)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel Core i3-6100 or AMD FX-4350</td><td>Intel Core i5-3570K or AMD equivalent</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>6GB</td><td>8GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 AMD Radeon HD 7730</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 AMD Radeon R9 290</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU RAM</strong></td><td>1GB</td><td>8GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hard Drive</strong></td><td>22GB of Free Space</td><td>22GB of Free Space</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Nintendo Switch</strong></p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-switch.png"                                     ></p><p>On March 9, 2021, EA released a version of this game for Nintendo switch. Currently, it is playable on the switch, and you can only match up with switch players, but soon it will be available to play with cross-platform support. It is a big achievement for EA to make this game playable on a small screen.</p><hr><h4 id="Apex-Legends-Steam-Vs-Origin-What’s-The-Difference"><a href="#Apex-Legends-Steam-Vs-Origin-What’s-The-Difference" class="headerlink" title="Apex Legends: Steam Vs Origin What’s The Difference?"></a><strong>Apex Legends: Steam Vs Origin What’s The Difference?</strong></h4><p>Apex Legends is playable on PC via both <strong>Steam and Origin</strong>. These are basically two different platforms and have their own game launchers. As the game is free to play so you can use either one of them.</p><p>If steam is already installed on your PC then just go to the game store and add Apex Legends to your library. Otherwise, you can also go to Origin game store and get Apex Legends from there. If you compare the performance of game on both platforms then you will find that there isn’t much difference. On origin you may get slightly better performance and fps but the difference of fps is not that much. The game is free to play on both platforms so you can choose according to your comfort and preferences.</p><h4 id="How-to-Choose-Between-These-Platforms"><a href="#How-to-Choose-Between-These-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose Between These Platforms"></a><strong>How to Choose Between These Platforms</strong></h4><p>With Apex Legends available on so many platforms, sometimes it can be difficult to choose which platform is best for you. It all depends upon your preferences. If you already have a gaming console like X-box or PS4, you can play it on them. But if you want to play in a competitive environment and get the best gaming experience, then it is only possible on a PC.

This is somewhat similar to what people did back in the Yahoo! Messenger era. However, unlike Yahoo! Messenger, Zoom doesn’t have open rooms where users could find new friends. Instead, it allows to chat only with those who are connected to each other through a conference call.</p><p>When talking about the chat configurations, all the contextual options can be accessed by clicking the <strong>Settings</strong> (<strong>Gear</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window, and selecting the <strong>Chat</strong> category from the left bar of the <strong>Settings</strong> window that opens up next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-setting.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Settings icon"                ></p><p>Once there, following are the options that you can configure to secure your <strong>Zoom chat</strong> experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Status</strong></li></ul><p>Checked by default, the <strong>Change my status to “Away” when I am inactive for</strong> ‘n’ <strong>minutes</strong> lets you automatically change your active status to <strong>Away</strong> when Zoom doesn’t detect any input from you for a certain amount of time. The inactive time threshold can be configured by entering a value in the available box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unblocking</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Manage blocked users</strong> button next to the <strong>Blocked users</strong> label lets you view the list all the users you have blocked. The <strong>Unblock</strong> button at the bottom of the <strong>Blocked users</strong> box allows you to unblock the users for chatting.</p><ul><li><strong>Push Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The radio buttons under this section let you choose which type of chat messages can trigger push notifications so they are flashed on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-notification-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Nofitications Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Other Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Keywords</strong> button next to the <strong>Receive notifications for</strong> label lets you define the keywords in the chat messages that can trigger notifications.</p><ul><li><strong>DND</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Do not disturb from</strong> checkbox allows you to define the duration of the day when Zoom won’t notify you about any chat messages.</p><ul><li><strong>Message Previews</strong></li></ul><p>When the <strong>Show message preview</strong> box is unchecked, Zoom prevents the text of the chat messages from appearing on the screen, and you must open the message to view its content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557746/17382" target="_top" id="1557746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557746/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom"></a>Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom</h2><p>When it comes to texting there are several options available for you to choose <strong>how to chat in Zoom</strong>. For instance, you can send a message to everyone in the chat or send a private message to one of the participants, mention participant(s) while typing a message, and can even send a file to them if need be. You can learn how to do all these by following their corresponding methods given below:</p><h3 id="1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat"><a href="#1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat" class="headerlink" title="1. How to Mention People in Zoom Chat?"></a>1. How to Mention People in Zoom Chat?</h3><p>As it is with most social media platforms these days, even in Zoom chat, you can use the @ sign followed by the starting few characters of the person you want to mention. When you start typing, a list of participants with the matching names would appear, and you can then choose the one you want to mention.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-Send-Chat-Announcements"><a href="#2-How-to-Send-Chat-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="2.

While the first two steps explain how to enable the <strong>Announcements</strong> feature and add the users who can send or receive announcements, the third step teaches how to send announcements to all the users you added.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enable-Announcements"><a href="#Step-1-Enable-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enable Announcements"></a>Step 1: Enable Announcements</h4><p>Launch your favorite browser, sign in to the web portal of your Zoom account, go to <strong>Account Management</strong> &gt; <strong>IM Management</strong> &gt; <strong>IM Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Visibility</strong> and then turn on the <strong>Announcements</strong> switch.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Add-Users-for-Announcements"><a href="#Step-2-Add-Users-for-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add Users for Announcements"></a>Step 2: Add Users for Announcements</h4><p>Click the <strong>+</strong> icon, in the available field type the email address(es) of the user(s) you want to allow to send or receive the announcements and click <strong>Add</strong> to add the participant(s) once found. Next, you can now safely sign out of the web portal of your Zoom account, and proceed to the next step.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Send-Announcements"><a href="#Step-3-Send-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Send Announcements"></a>Step 3: Send Announcements</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-announcement.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Announcements"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983539">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983539">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983539%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983539/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Launch Zoom app and sign into your account.

However, by signing in to your account on Zoom’s web portal, you can restrict them by their extensions. For example, you can configure your Zoom account to send only the files with JPG, ZIP, or RAR extensions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Save-Zoom-Chats"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Save-Zoom-Chats" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Save Zoom Chats"></a>Part 3: How to Save Zoom Chats</h2><p>Zoom also allows you to save your text conversions for future references.

Can Zoom host see private chats?"></a><strong>Q) Is Zoom chat secure, safe, and encrypted? Can Zoom host see private chats?</strong></h4><p><strong>A) Yes and No.</strong></p><p>To answer the first question, Zoom chats are encrypted. However, the encryption is disabled by default and must be enabled by turning on the <strong>Require Encryption for 3rd Party Endpoints (H323&#x2F;SIP)</strong> switch from the <strong>In Meeting (Basic)</strong> section.</p><p>Tips</p><p>As a video call host, if you don’t want the participant to save the chat content, you should enable <strong>Prevent participants from saving chat</strong> and save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-prevent-participants-from-saving-chat.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Saving Settings"                ></p><p>Furthermore, if you have a paid subscription of Zoom, you can use advanced encryption method that is available on the <strong>IM Management</strong> page on your account’s web portal. About the second question, the host cannot see the private messages that the participants send to each other during a meeting session.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing"><a href="#Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing" class="headerlink" title="Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?"></a><strong>Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?</strong></h4><p>A) No.</p><p>As long as you are chatting using <strong>Zoom chat</strong>, other participants cannot see your conversation. However, if there is something else on your screen such as your Facebook profile&#x2F;chat, your email account, or your bank account’s page, all those windows can be viewed by the participants you are sharing your screen with.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom chat</strong> is an easy way to converse with the participants in case there are some typical words that need to be spelled or some files to be shared. These chats are not only encrypted, they can also be controlled by the host so that the participants can send messages only to the host, to each other, or to no one at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012429/19272" target="_top" id="2012429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012429/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-16-crowning-youtube-opens-for-enhanced-reach/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved 16 Crowning YouTube Opens for Enhanced Reach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-maximize-impact-video-resizing-techniques-for-instagram/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Maximize Impact Video Resizing Techniques for Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-unmask-background-ambiance-free-or-paid-solutions-explored-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unmask Background Ambiance - Free or Paid Solutions Explored for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-the-secrets-to-successful-iphone-sound-captures-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unveiling the Secrets to Successful iPhone Sound Captures for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-avoiding-lost-frames-during-video-capture-in-obs/"><u>[Updated] Avoiding Lost Frames During Video Capture in OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-meringue-movie-magic-step-by-step-guide-to-ice-cream-capture/"><u>[Updated] Meringue Movie Magic Step-by-Step Guide to Ice Cream Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovation-unleashed-new-samsung-ubd-k8500-review/"><u>2024 Approved Innovation Unleashed - New Samsung UBD-K8500 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-professional-approaches-for-logging-youtube-streams/"><u>2024 Approved Professional Approaches for Logging YouTube Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/boosting-your-gaming-footage-on-latest-windows-11/"><u>Boosting Your Gaming Footage on Latest Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/bring-back-the-memories-top-5-ps1-emulation-apps-for-pc/"><u>Bring Back the Memories - Top 5 PS1 Emulation Apps for PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/construct-powerpoint-into-digital-film-for-2024/"><u>Construct PowerPoint Into Digital Film for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/high-quality-win11-screen-capture-pro/"><u>High-Quality Win11 Screen Capture Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-off-find-my-apple-iphone-13-when-phone-is-broken-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Turn Off Find My Apple iPhone 13 when Phone is Broken?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-poco-x6-pro-pattern-lock-if-forgotten-6-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Poco X6 Pro Pattern Lock if Forgotten? 6 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-secrets-of-hosting-no-cost-seminars-on-the-worlds-largest-video-platform/"><u>In 2024, Secrets of Hosting No-Cost Seminars on the World’s Largest Video Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-howtos.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-moving-ebook-files-from-laptop-to-nook-device-efficiently/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Moving eBook Files From Laptop to Nook Device Efficiently</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
